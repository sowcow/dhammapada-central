1: In this verse (and the following one, DhP 2) some philosophical observations are
  made about the nature of our mind. It says that all the mental phenomena, happiness
  or suffering, joy or sorrow are made by, or are the outcome of, the quality of the
  mind. These mental phenomena are (according to the teachings of Abhidhamma) feelings
  (vedanā), perception (saññā) and volitional activities (saṅkhāra). And because these
  phenomena are created by, or so closely related to, the mind, they are always "colored"
  in the same way as the mind is. If the mind (as in this verse) is corrupted, full
  of evil thoughts, then only suffering and sorrow awaits us as a result of this.
  In other words, the mind, creating these mental phenomena simply creates them "to
  its own image". Therefore, negative thinking always brings with it suffering and
  sorrow, just as the wheel follows in the path of the animal carrying the charriot.
  We experience suffering only because our minds are not purified, we are not awakened.
  To purify the mind is to get rid of suffering once and for all.
2: This verse is closely related to the previous one (DhP 1). If the mind is purified,
  the mental phenomena it creates are also pure. Therefore, joy and happiness follow
  as surely as suffering and sorrow in case of a defiled mind. As we can see from
  these two verses, happiness and suffering depends on us entirely, on our own minds,
  on the thoughts that we are harboring. There is no other way to happiness then purification
  of mind and ultimately, in destroying all the defilement completely and reaching
  the highest goal, the awakenment of Nirvana.
3: This verse speaks about the very well known fact, so stressed by the modern psychology.
  If we succumb to thoughts of injustice done to us, if we always consider ourselves
  "poor things" that the "strong ones" play with, our suffering and hatred will never
  disappear, but it will increase, because "they" will feel our insecurity and will
  enjoy inflicting pain on us even more. "Oh, how could he (or she, for that matter)
  do this to me? It is so unfair!" By this thinking we will certainly not prevent
  these things to happen in the future again. How to deal with this situation is spoken
  about in the following verse.
4: This verse is a "twin verse" of the previous one. If we can not conquer the hatred
  and suffering by crying and feeling powerless, it is exactly by the absence of such
  thoughts, that our hatred will disappear and dissolve. And when those people who
  enjoy making us suffer, see that we are not intimidated and do not give in to their
  way of thinking, they will eventually stop this kind of behavior. Indeed, it is
  said very easily and the majority of people will quickly agree with it, but it is
  extremely difficult to bring this idea to life. Therefore, we must practice this
  more often in our daily lives -- and our effort must bear its fruits.
5: This pair of verses (DhP 5 and 6) is very close in meaning to the previous pair
  (DhP 3 and 4). Again, a very simple truth, that most of the religions in the history
  have stressed again and again. The only cure for hatred is the abstention from it.
  Never can we stop people from hating us by hating them. In this way, mutual hatred
  will rise -- often to the point when hatred gives way to violence. The only way
  to stop this chain of hatred is to stop hating, of course. As the verse says, this
  is an eternal law. It was always so and always will be. One can only wish that we
  could remember this verse in all situations and deal accordingly. How many wars,
  how much suffering could be easily averted just by taking the advice of this short
  verse seriously.
6: This verse is related to the previous one (DhP 5), even if this relation is not
  apparent immediately. In DhP 5 we are told that hatred can not be appeased by hatred
  but only by abstention from hatred. Here it says that some people do not understand
  this, do not know that we should restrain ourselves, that we should not give in
  to hatred. Those who realize that, of course, stop their enmity and quarreling,
  thus stopping hatred completely. By the word "others" the authors probably meant
  the people, who do not realize this eternal law (that hatred can be appeased by
  non-hatred only). The use of the word "here" ("that we should restrain ourselves
  here") suggests this world, our present situation. It can also point to the previous
  verse -- then we should understand "here" as "this" (meaning this eternal law of
  appeasing hatred by non-hatred).
7: What we have described here, is a recipe, how to become a prey of our own mind.
  For Mara, The Evil One, is not some outside force, some "devil" or deity of death
  and destruction, it is only our mind, our bad habits, laziness, evil intentions
  and especially ignorance, the true root of all evil. If we dwell with our minds
  only on the pleasant things, if we indulge in enjoying pleasurable things (subhānupassiṃ
  viharantaṃ), then it is easy for these tendencies in our brain ("Mara") to gain
  strength. The same thing happens, when we are unrestrained in six senses (eye, ear,
  nose, tongue, body and mind), taking in without restraint and reflection everything
  that comes and if we never have enough of sense pleasures (indriyesu asaṃvutaṃ).
  And of course, if we do not know moderation in food, we can expect the same result,
  because indulgence in food is actually a part of lack of restraint in senses (bhojanamhi
  cāmattaññuṃ). Laziness (kusītaṃ) and lack of effort to change our ways (hīnavīriyaṃ)
  will not help us to get rid of these bad habits and the roots of meditative life
  will slowly wither and die away. And without strong, often cultivated roots, the
  tree of our practice will not grow higher and higher, will never bring fruits in
  reaching the Nirvana, but our bad tendencies will subdue us, our hope for reaching
  the goal, just as easily, as wind uproots a weak tree.
8: Here, on the other hand (in contrast to DhP 7) is described the way, how to nourish
  the roots of meditative life, how to destroy the bad tendencies, how to become immune
  to Mara, to the evil part of our mind. We must not dwell with our minds only on
  the pleasant things and indulge in enjoying pleasurable things (asubhānupassiṃ viharantaṃ).
  Another way to understand this phrase is that we should contemplate the unpleasant
  things, to understand that there is really nothing to be attached to, that attachment
  to pleasant things brings about the strength of "Mara", of our bad habits and tendencies.
  We must also be well restrained (indriyesu susaṃvutaṃ) in senses and know moderation
  in food (bhojanamhi ca mattaññuṃ). Thus, senses are guarded, we do not take everything
  in indiscriminately, and we contemplate on what we see, hear, smell, taste, touch
  and think. We are not attached to pleasant sense-impressions, we do not hate unpleasant
  sense-impressions, and we are observant and concentrated and thus able to bring
  meditation to everyday life. Important part is also trust (saddhaṃ). Trust in the
  way, that the Buddha taught us, trust in the methods that are part of the way, trust
  in the goal that can be reached by following this way. Without this basic trust
  (which is not blind faith, for it is easily verified, as we go forward on the way)
  no progress is possible. We must also be firm in effort (āraddhavīriyaṃ). Effort
  is of course a basic necessity. We must make an effort to put everything that was
  said above into our daily lives. It is only by this constant effort, that we are
  able to progress towards the goal. If we practice in this way, the roots of meditation
  will flourish, will become strong and invincible. Eventually, the tree of our practice
  will bear its fruit, our mind will reach the peaceful state of Nirvana. Mara, the
  dark side of our mind has no way to influence us, no way to overcome us, just like
  the wind is not able to blow away a rocky mountain.
9: 'This verse as well as the following one (DhP 10) talks about who is and who is
  not worthy to wear a monk''s robe. One, who did not get rid of defilement (anikkasāvo),
  who is full of these impurities, who does not know self-control and restraint (dama)
  and who is far away (apeto) from truth (sacca), does not deserve to wear a yellow
  robe. Such a person can not call himself a monk, even if he should be dressed in
  the monk''s robe. As defilement (kasāva) are usually understood so called three
  roots of evil: lobha (greed), dosa (hatred) and moha (delusion).'
10: In contrast to DhP 9, the person, who deserves to wear a monk's robe is described
  here. Who "threw up", or got completely rid of, defilement (vantakasāvo), who is
  well settled and well established in his virtues (sīlesu susamāhito) and who is
  endowed (upeto) with restraint (dama) and knows the truth (sacca), such a person
  deserves to wear a yellow monk's robe. Such a person can truly be called a monk.
11: One can of course never expect to understand, or get close to, the "essence",
  the heart of the problem, if one keeps looking in the wrong direction. This is true
  in every field of our endeavor. Therefore this rule necessarily applies also to
  spiritual efforts. This verse says that if we mistake the essential things for nonsense
  and think that there is some essence in things that are actually empty of it, we
  can not ever get even close to the reality. All kinds of superstition fall into
  this category, various activities that (although they look nice and can be even
  pleasant) do not bring us closer to the goal, which is the purification of mind.
  As the verse notes, this is the "pasture for wrong thoughts". As the cows on the
  pasture, the thoughts, wandering in this direction, will grow stronger and will
  multiply. The only problem is -- it will not help us on our way at all.
12: In contrast to DhP 11, if we really know, what is important and what is empty,
  if we know, where the essence lies, it is possible for us to discover it. We can
  take as an example the case if we want to clean the dirty floor. It will not help
  us to start scrubbing the table. Sure, a clean table is a nice thing, but we wanted
  the floor to be clean, not the table. In the same way, if we want to purify our
  mind, we must carefully decide and understand, how to do it, what is the correct
  procedure. If we know, what is essential in order to reach our goal, then we have
  a chance of accomplishing it. This is a "pasture for right thoughts". The right
  thoughts will grow and multiply -- this time only for our benefit.
13: A roof is the most important part of any house. If the roof is not well done,
  if we try to "cheat" and use cheap material of poor quality, we can be surprised
  when a strong rain comes. The roof will not be able to hold off the water and it
  will leak. Everything inside the house then becomes wet instantly - and after the
  rain we can start building again. In the same way, the mind is the most important
  part of the human being. If it is not "well developed", if we have not practiced
  meditation earnestly, it will also "leak". The passions, hatred and other stuff
  will enter our mind and make it difficult for us to purify our minds. After one
  such "rain" we can start "rebuilding" our mind again.
14: And (continuing from DhP 13) if the roof on our house is well done, if we have
  made careful plans and executed them well, if we paid enough attention to the roof,
  then we do not have to be afraid of any rain, no matter how strong. The roof will
  hold it and the inside of the house will not become flooded, not even wet. And in
  the case of mind, the same rule applies. If we made a conscious decision to develop
  it, to keep high level of mindfulness and alert, if we sharpen our mind in meditation,
  all the passions have no way of entering. The "roof" holds and we can concentrate
  on our main goal -- cleansing the mind, without a need to repair the roof after
  every light shower.
15: Doing evil deeds is a sure way to grief and despair. As we know from modern history,
  the greatest evildoers of this century (Stalin, Mao, Hitler, etc.) did not have
  an easy life. Their were troubled personalities, seeing enemies behind every shadow.
  The amount of evil they created hunted them mercilessly and efficiently. If we commit
  an evil deed (a definition of evil deed is that it is an action which harms other
  living beings in any way -- physical or mental) not only our consciences bothers
  us (or at least it should, if we are to call ourselves human beings), but it will
  also bring us a bad rebirth. Thus, when we see our evil deeds, we will grieve both
  in this life and in the next one.
16: In direct contrast to the verse 15 (see), if we commit good deeds, helping all
  living beings in different ways, we will not only be happy in this life, having
  the satisfaction of doing good deeds, but we will also obtain a favorable rebirth.
  So, when we see our good deeds, we rejoice in the knowledge thereof.
17: This pair of verses (DhP 17 and DhP 18) is closely related to the previous pair
  (DhP 15 and DhP 16). Here again, the evildoer is tormented both here and in the
  next life. Not only does the very idea that he has done evil torment him, but even
  more grief awaits him in his next life, where he will go to the undesirable states
  of being -- as an animal, to the hell etc.
18: In contrast to the previous verse (DhP 17), one, who performs good deeds is happy
  and delighted both in this life and after death. The idea "I have done good deeds"
  brings him inner satisfaction and happiness. Even more happiness then brings him
  his next birth - as a human being (the best of all possibilities), as a celestial
  being in various heavenly worlds etc.
19: The teacher must act according to his own words. A monk, who talks nice, true
  words, but his acts are not in accordance with them, does not really share the blessings
  of monk's life. He is like a hireling, doing work for others. A cowherd is poor,
  he usually does not have his own cows, and he just takes others' cows out to the
  pasture. He does not have a real profit out of his actions. In the same sense, the
  monk who only talks about the Buddha's teachings, but does not put them into practice
  himself, does not reap the fruit thereof, is just like the cowherd. Thus he neglects
  his own practice and as we will soon hear in coming verses, the negligence is not
  a good path to take.
20: So, who can be truly called a monk, who shares the blessings of monkshood? It
  must be a person, who is living in accordance with the Dharma, as proclaimed by
  the Buddha. He must abandon all three roots of evil (lust, hatred and delusion),
  must have the right knowledge of the Dharma and his mind must be liberated. He must
  not of course be attached to anything in this world, but neither to anything in
  his possible future rebirths. Such a person is sharing all the blessings of monkshood,
  even if he does not preach the Dharma a lot.
21: Conscientiousness is one of the most important characteristics to be developed.
  Without it, we can not proceed on our path towards awakenment. If we are negligent,
  how can we find energy to purify our minds? So, the conscientiousness is the path
  to deathlessness. Only with it we can find our way to the final goal, Nirvana, which
  is the deathless state. Negligence on the other hand is the way to the repeated
  cycle of birth and death. Conscientious people are able to reach the Nirvana, thus
  escaping the cycle of rebirths, whereas those, who are negligent, can not escape.
  They might as well be dead already.
22: The wise people know very clearly, that the conscientiousness is the state of
  deathlessness (the word thus refers to the previous verse, DhP 21). Therefore, they
  rejoice in conscientiousness, they praise it and pay high attention to it. They
  are delighting in the "sphere of the Noble Ones". This is of course nothing else
  than the Nirvana. So, again, the only way to reach this state is to make conscientious
  effort in this direction, applying all one's energy and striving.
23: Continuing the line of reasoning from previous verses (DhP 21 and DhP 22), if
  one knows, that conscientiousness is the key to reaching of the Nirvana, one maintains
  a high level of it. Applying this conscientiousness to the practice of meditation,
  one has to persevere, constantly and with strong effort. By this, we are able to
  reach Nirvana, to really "touch" it here and now. Thus, we obtain the highest peace
  from bondage, the only true peace and freedom available.
24: The story says that there was an heir of a rich family, named Kumbhaghosaka, once
  in the city of Rājagaha. His parents died in the epidemic and he alone escaped and
  lived in the forest for some time. When he returned, nobody recognized him. He did
  not want to use the family wealth (which was buried in a safe place) out of fear
  that people might think he found it accidentally and thus the king might confiscate
  it. So he found a job (waking people in the morning) and lived a poor life. But
  the king saw him once and recognized that his voice and manners are of a man of
  great wealth. He then sent his maid to investigate. At the end he summoned Kumbhaghosaka
  to the court. There the young man told him the story and the king made him a banker
  and gave his daughter in marriage to him. When the Buddha heard about it, he spoke
  this verse. If one always acts properly, with energy and mindfulness, applies self-control
  and consideration, is always conscientious, his good repute will increase, because
  people will know that he is a man of honor, that they can trust him. And they will
  report this to the others - who will then come to see for themselves, again telling
  other people about this. So the good word will spread around and everybody will
  trust such a person.
25: With this verse is associated the famous story of Cūḷapanthaka. There were two
  brothers, Mahāpantkaha and Cūḷapanthaka. Both become monks, but Cūḷapanthaka was
  not very clever and he was not able to learn the Buddha's Teachings. Mahāpantkaha
  on the other hand was very bright and he soon became an arahant. The Buddha once
  gave a clean piece of cloth to Cūḷapantkaha and told him to rub it while repeating
  the words "taking on impurity". Cūḷapanthaka then did as instructed and soon the
  cloth became dirty. The Buddha then told him, that our mind is very similar to that
  piece of cloth, becoming dirty with the "dust of passion, hatred and delusion. Attaining
  of arahantship is not very different from cleaning the piece of cloth - we have
  to "wash" our minds of this dust diligently. Cūḷapanthaka realized this and practiced
  meditation accordingly. Soon, he too became an arahant, as his elder brother. The
  Buddha then spoke this verse, telling us that only by diligence, self-control and
  applying energy we can make an island in ourselves which the flood of passion, hatred
  and delusion will not be able to overwhelm.
26: The story associated with this verse and the following one (DhP 27) speaks about
  a festival that was celebrated in the city of Sāvatthī while the Buddha was residing
  there. Many young men were practicing some sort of religious rituals, roaming about
  the city, shouting and begging for money at every door in the city. Buddha's lay
  disciples in that city warned him not to enter the city and they themselves did
  not leave their houses. After one week of the festival ended, the Buddha again entered
  Sāvatthī and then spoke these two verses (DhP 26 and 27).
27: The story for this verse is the same as for the previous one (see DhP 26). Whereas
  the foolish and ignorant ones indulge in negligence and sense-pleasures, as the
  young men did during the festival in Sāvatthī, those, who are wise, treasure the
  conscientiousness like a jewel. If they practice the meditation diligently, with
  perseverance, never becoming negligent, they will at the end definitely reach the
  "abundant happiness" - which is of course only another term for the Awakenment and
  the Nirvana.
28: The story says, that one of the chief disciples of the Buddha, the Elder Mahākassapa
  was once practicing meditation, trying to find out which of the beings in the world
  were conscientious and which were negligent. He also tried to find who was about
  to be born and who was about to die. The Buddha learned about this and told him
  not to waste his time on something like that - because such things do not lead to
  the Awakenment. In addition to that, such a task is possible only for a Buddha,
  because of the innumerable beings in the world. The Buddha the spoke this verse.
  The negligence is of course best dispelled with the conscientiousness. When we are
  able to do that, we will "climb the stronghold of wisdom", we will reach the Nirvana.
  Then we can look at the others, who are still negligent, as somebody on the top
  of a mountain can watch the people on the plain below him.
29: Once, there were two monks, who were friends. They both got a subject of meditation
  from the Buddha. So they went to the forest monastery to meditate. One of them was
  rather lazy. Because it was winter, he was warming himself by the fire the first
  part of the night and the other part he spent talking to other monks and novices.
  But the other monk was very mindful and diligent. He spent the night meditating
  and soon he became an arahant. After the end of the retreat they went back to see
  the Buddha. The lazy monk actually accused the diligent one of laziness! He told
  Buddha, whereas he himself was first warming himself by the fire and then "not-sleeping",
  his friend was idling, lying down and sleeping all the time. But the Buddha of course
  knew the truth and he told them this verse. One friend was like a weak horse, lazy
  and talkative, but the other one, like a swift horse, was diligent and mindful.
  And he left the other friend behind - he became an arahant.
30: 'A young prince named Mahāli from the Licchavi state came to see the Buddha. He
  wanted to hear some teachings, so the Buddha told him the Sakkapañha Sutta (The
  Sutta of Sakka''s questions). Mahāli wondered how was it possible, that the Buddha
  knew so much about Sakka, the king of the gods. Has the Buddha ever met Sakka? The
  Buddha confirmed that he indeed has seen Sakka and further told Mahāli the story
  of Sakka''s previous existence. He was a man named Magha. He was very righteous
  and did a lot of charitable work, building roads and rest houses with his friends.
  He took seven obligations: to support his parents, to respect elders, to be gentle
  of speech, to avoid backbiting, to be generous and not avaricious, to speak the
  truth and to restrain himself from loosing temper. He was always mindful and kept
  all of them. Thus in his next existence he became Sakka, the king of gods.'
31: 'Once there was a monk who received his subject of meditation from the Buddha.
  He practiced hard, but he made very little progress. So he became very depressed
  and frustrated. He went to see the Buddha about his problems. But on the way there
  he saw a big forest fire. He ran to the top of a mountain and observed. While there,
  he realized that just as the fire burnt up everything around, be it big or small,
  so the insights from the practice of meditation will burn up all the fetters, big
  and small. The Buddha saw this from far away and appeared in front of the monk telling
  him that he was on the right track and to keep up the idea. The monk did accordingly
  and attained arahantship very soon. According to Buddhist philosophy, there are
  ten fetters (saṃyojana). They can be divided into two kinds, five so called "lower"
  or "big" fetters and five "higher" or "small" fetters. The five big fetters are:
  1) personality belief (sakkāya-diṭṭhi), 2) skeptical doubt (vicikicchā), 3) clinging
  to rules and rituals (sīlabbata-paramāsa), 4) sensuous craving (kāma-rāga), 5) ill-will
  (vyāpāda). The five small fetters are: 1) craving for fine-material existence (rūpa-rāga),
  2) craving for immaterial existence (arūpa-rāga), 3) conceit (māna), 4) restlessness
  (uddhacca), 5) ignorance (avijjā).'
32: 'Nigamavātissa was born and grew up in a small market town near Sāvatthi. He became
  a monk and lived a simple life. For his alms food he went to the village where his
  relatives lived and he kept away from all the big occasions. Even when big benefactors
  like Anāthapiṇḍika and king Pasenadi of Kosala gave monks alms on a grand scale,
  he did not attend. Some monks started to say, that he keeps only to his relatives
  and does not care about things. The Buddha asked him about this. He replied that
  he goes to his village only for alms food, takes only as much as is enough, does
  not care if it is tasty or not. The Buddha praised him and told the other monks
  that they should all behave in this way. He also related the story of the king of
  parrots: He lived in a grove of fig trees on the banks of Ganga with many subjects.
  When all the fruits were eaten, everybody left, except for the king, who was satisfied
  with little. Once Sakka, the king of gods, wanted to test him and his resolve. He
  assumed the form of a goose and asked him why doesn''t he move away. The king said
  he can not leave out of the gratitude towards the tree. If he can find enough food
  to get by, he wouldn''t go. It would be ungrateful. Sakka was impressed and revealed
  himself. Then he poured the Ganga water over the withered tree and it was suddenly
  green and full of fruit. Then the Buddha said, that the king of parrots was himself
  in one of his previous existences and Sakka was Anuruddha, one of the Buddha''s
  foremost disciples. He then uttered this verse (DhP 32). At the end of the discourse,
  Nigamavātissa became an arahant.'
33: Once the Buddha was staying on Cālika mountain. One of the monks, Meghiya Thera
  was attending upon him. This Thera saw a nice mango grove and asked the Buddha for
  permission to go there for meditation. But there were no other monks at that time
  and the Buddha needed an attendance. So he told Meghiya to wait for arrival of somebody
  else and then he could go. But Meghiya wanted to go really badly, so he asked the
  Buddha again and again, until he got his permission. He went to the grove and started
  to meditate, only to find out that his mind was wandering. He stayed there the whole
  day, but made no progress. In the evening he reported to the Buddha, how he was
  all the time assailed by thoughts associated with senses, ill will and cruelty.
  The Buddha told him the verses 33 and 34 and Meghiya attained Sotāpatti, the first
  stage on the way to awakenment.
34: The story for this verse is the same as for the previous one (DhP 33). Our mind
  is indeed wavering, writhing and difficult to restrain, like a snake or a young
  branch. An arrow maker making an arrow has to straighten it first; otherwise it
  would be a worthless arrow. In the same way, we have to straighten the mind; otherwise
  we cannot hit the goal with it. When we want to leave Mara's realm, the world, the
  mind trembles and flickers just like a fish thrown on a dry ground, suddenly without
  its familiar surroundings, unable to relate to this new situation.
35: Sixty monks received their meditation subjects from the Buddha and they went to
  the village of Mātika. There the mother of the village headman, called Mātikamātā,
  built a monastery for them and gave them alms food regularly. So they decided to
  spend the Rain Retreat there. She asked them to teach her some Dharma and they taught
  her the 32 body parts and awareness of the body's decay. She practiced diligently
  and attained the third (last but one) stage of awakenment. She also attained some
  supernormal powers; she was able to read other people's minds. She used this power
  and saw that the sixty monks have not so far attained anything. She saw, that they
  all had potential for arahantship, but they needed proper food. So she gave them
  alms food and soon they all became arahants. At the end of the retreat they went
  back to the Buddha and reported what happened. A certain monk decided to go to the
  same village. Mātikamātā personally came to the monastery and gave him alms food.
  He asked her about her supernormal powers, but she evaded this subject. He got scared
  that she will see his impure mind and left the village. He told the Buddha about
  his fears, but the Buddha sent him back, telling him to control his mind under all
  circumstances. So the monk went back, thinking only about his meditation subject.
  Mātikamātā made sure that he had enough alms food and the monk too attained arahantship
  soon.
36: Once in the city of Sāvatthi, there lived a son of a banker. He asked a monk who
  came to his house for alms food, how to be liberated from the ills of life. The
  monk instructed him to divide his property into three parts. One he was to do business
  with, one to support his family, one for charity. The man did so and then asked
  what to do next. He was instructed to take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha
  and to observe five precepts. But the man was still not satisfied. So the monk told
  him to renounce the world and to become a monk too. As a monk he was taught Dharma
  by one teacher and Vinaya by another. Thus he felt that there was too much to learn,
  the rules were too strict and there was no freedom. He wanted to return to lay life.
  He began to have doubts, was discontent and unhappy, neglected his meditation. The
  Buddha told him that if he only could control his mind, he had nothing else to control.
  Then he told him this verse. The monk attained arahantship.
37: 'Saṅgharakkhita Thera was from the city of Sāvatthi. His sister gave birth to
  a son. People called him "The nephew Saṅgharakkhita". He also became a monk. Once
  he was offered two sets of robes. He wanted to give one set to his uncle. So at
  the end of the retreat he went to see him, but his uncle did not want a robe, saying
  he had enough. The young man felt bad, thinking the uncle does not want to share
  with him. So he decided to leave the Order. His mind began to wander and a train
  of thoughts appeared. When he became a layman he would sell his robes and buy a
  goat. The goat would breed quickly and soon he would have enough money to marry.
  His wife would give birth to a son. He would take his wife and son in a cart to
  see the uncle. On the way he would say he could carry the child. She would tell
  him to drive that she could carry the baby. But he will insist and grab the child.
  The child would fall down and the wheel would pass over him. He would get furious
  and hit his wife with the goading stick. At that time he was fanning the Thera and
  absentmindedly hit him with the fan. His uncle said: "You were unable to beat your
  wife, why hit an old monk?" The young man was embarrassed and frightened of his
  uncle, so he fled. The monks chased him and took him to see the Buddha. He told
  him the verse and said that the mind has ability to think of objects far away and
  that one should strive for liberation. The young monk attained the first stage of
  awakenment.'
38: 'A certain man from Sāvatthi was once looking for his ox lost in the forest. He
  got hungry so he went to a village monastery, where the monks gave him the remains
  of the morning meal. While eating, he realized that he was working hard every day,
  but did not even have enough food. What if he became a monk? So he asked the monks
  to grant him an ordination. As a monk he had plenty of food, soon he was quite fat.
  After some time he grew tired of going for alms and so he decided to become a layman
  again. Later he again changed his mind, thinking the life too strenuous and became
  a monk. In this way he left the Order and came back six times. While he was going
  back and forth, his wife became pregnant. Once he entered their bedroom when she
  was asleep. She was almost naked, snoring loudly, saliva trickling down the mouth.
  This and her bloated stomach made her look like a corpse. He was able to perceive
  impermanence and unpleasantness of the body. He was thinking that he was a monk
  for several times and only because of this woman he was not able to stay. So he
  left home for seventh time, repeating as he went the words "impermanence" and "suffering"
  and on the way to the monastery he attained the first stage of awakenment. But the
  monks did not want to permit him into the Order, joking: "You have been shaving
  your head so often, that it looks like a whetting stone." He asked once more and
  the monks granted him the ordination one last time. Within few days he attained
  arahantship. The monks were surprised to see him staying so long, so they asked
  what happened. The man said he had no attachments any more, so why would he leave.
  But they did not believe him and asked the Buddha, who said it was the truth. The
  man was an arahant now, who discarded both the ideas of good and evil.'
39: The story for this verse is identical with the previous one (DhP 38). If the mind
  is unsteady, the confidence in the Teaching wavering and one is not really resolved
  to do anything about it, the wisdom will not grow. But with a strong conscientiousness
  and watchfulness, the mind can get rid of the passions and unsteadiness. Then one
  is able to abandon all the ideas of good and evil and become free, just like the
  man from our story did.
40: 'Our body is like a jar, very fragile. And our mind should be like a fortified
  city, guarded everywhere. The story for this verse says: Five hundred monks from
  Sāvatthi received the meditation subjects and went far away to a large grove. The
  guardian spirits of the trees there saw that the monks came and decided that it
  would be impolite to stay in the trees. So they descended, thinking the monks will
  only stay one night. But they decided to spend the Rain retreat there. The spirits
  did not want to live on the ground so long, so they scared the monks by terrible
  sounds and ghostly images. The monks ran away and told the Buddha what happened.
  He told them that they did not have any weapon, so they must be armed with loving
  kindness (Mettā). He then taught them the Mettā sutta. He further instructed them
  to recite the poem from the outskirts of the forest and enter the monastery still
  reciting. The monks did accordingly. The spirits received their loving kindness,
  welcomed them and did them no harm. The monks meditated on the 32 parts of the body
  and realized its impermanence. The Buddha saw it from away, appeared in front of
  them, saying, yes, the body is like a jar. He also told them this verse (DhP 40).
  All five hundred monks became arahants.'
41: There was a monk called Thera Tissa. He diligently meditated and had many students,
  but then he was afflicted with a disease. Small boils appeared all over his body,
  and then big sores developed from them. Later sores burst, emitting pus and blood;
  his robes became dirty and stinky. The monks called him Pūtigatatissa, Tissa with
  stinking body. They kept away from him, even his pupils abandoned him, and nobody
  would go near him. The Buddha saw his sorrowful state, saw that he would soon die,
  but that he could also attain arahantship very quickly. So the Buddha went to the
  fire-shed close to the place, where the Thera was living. He boiled some water,
  went to the monk's room and started to carry him out. Other monks also gathered
  and helped him to carry the sick Thera out. They brought him to the fire-shed, bathed
  him and washed his robes. After taking the bath, the monk became fresh in body and
  mind, he developed one-pointedness and concentration. The Buddha then related this
  verse (DhP 41) and Thera Tissa became an arahant immediately. Soon after that he
  passed away.
42: In the country of Kosala there once lived a herdsman named Nanda. He looked after
  the cows of the famous benefactor Anāthapiṇḍika. Sometimes he would go to Anāthapiṇḍika's
  house and listen to the Buddha's discourses. Once Nanda asked the Buddha to come
  to his house for alms food. The Buddha replied that he would come, but the time
  is not yet right and Nanda should wait. After some time the Buddha was traveling
  and went off his usual route to see Nanda, because he knew that the time for him
  to do so was ripe. Nanda received him, served the Buddha and monks milk and milk
  products and all kinds of food. This lasted for seven days. On the last day after
  hearing the Buddha's discourse, Nanda attained the first stage of awakenment. When
  the Buddha was leaving, Nanda carried his bowl for him some distance and then turned
  back home. Suddenly a hunter, his old enemy, shot him. The monks saw Nanda laying
  dead on the road. They told the Buddha that because of them, because they came to
  his house and he was accompanying them, Nanda died. But the Buddha said that there
  was no escape from death for him. And he told the monks this verse (DhP 42).
43: 'In the city of Soreyya, there once lived a son of rich man. His name was also
  Soreyya. Once he was going with friend in a luxurious carriage to take a bath. They
  saw Mahākaccāyana Thera adjusting his robe before he entered Soreyya to get his
  alms food. Soreyya said: "I wish the monk was my wife, or my wife had a complexion
  like he has!" With that he changed to a woman. He was ashamed and ran away and began
  to travel to the city of Taxila. His friend was looking for him everywhere, but
  did not find any trace. Soreyya (now woman) offered her ring to some people, going
  to Taxila, and they took her with them in a carriage. When they got there, the people
  told one young rich man about the beautiful girl who came with them to the city.
  The man married her. She gave birth to two sons, but also had two sons from the
  previous marriage as a man. Once a merchant from Soreyya came to Taxila to do some
  business. She sent for him, because she recognized an old friend in him. But of
  course, he did not know who she was. She asked many questions about her old family
  and other friends. The man related to her the story about the disappeared man. She
  revealed her identity and told him all what happened. The man advised her to ask
  pardon from the Thera. Mahākaccāyana was invited to her house and she offered him
  alms food. The lady explained what happened and asked for pardon. The Thera said:
  "Get up, I forgive you." With that she became a man again. But he kept thinking
  how during a single life his body could undergo two changes of sex and have children
  both as a man and as a woman. He felt these things were very repulsive and decided
  to leave the lay life. People often asked him if he loved more the two sons he had
  as a man or the two sons he had as a woman. He always answered that the sons whom
  he (as a woman) personally delivered were closer to him. People asked him this question
  so often that he became ashamed and annoyed. He stayed by himself, diligently meditating
  on the decay of the body. Soon he attained arahantship. When people again asked
  him the same question, he said he had no affection for any one in particular. Others
  thought he does not speak the truth, so they asked the Buddha about it. But he told
  them that Soreyya does not lie. Now he is an arahant, his well directed mind brought
  him a well being which neither the father nor the mother could bestow on him.'
44: 'A group of monks accompanied the Buddha to a certain village and then they all
  returned to the monastery. The monks started to talk about the trip. They paid close
  attention to the condition of the land: whether it was level or hilly, whether the
  soil was clayey or sandy etc. The Buddha visited them and when overheard the topic
  of their discussion, he told them to better concentrate on their own bodies. He
  said, that the earth is external and that they should strive to examine their own
  bodies and understand what they really are. He then added that by understanding
  one''s own body we are also able to understand the whole world. We will be able
  to realize the Dharma, just as a skilful garland-maker makes the garlands.'
45: The story for this verse is the same as for the previous one (DhP 44). The disciple
  of the Buddha is able to investigate this world. By understanding and realizing
  the Dharma we can also fully understand the whole world with all its beings, because
  the Dharma is after all concerned just with this world, its conditions and our position
  in this world. So, just as a skilful garland-maker can pick flowers easily, we,
  as Buddha's followers, can investigate the Dharma and with it the whole world.
46: A certain monk obtained his meditation subject from the Buddha. He went to the
  forest and practiced diligently. But for some reason he made very little progress
  and was not happy. He set out on a journey back to tell the Buddha about his difficulties
  and to obtain another meditation subject. But on the way he saw a mirage. He realized,
  that a mirage is only an illusion of water and that also his body is an illusion
  as well. He fixed his mind on this understanding and continued with his meditation.
  Later he went for a bath to a river and there he saw the foam, how it was insubstantial
  and breaking up quickly. Thus he further realized the impermanent nature of the
  body. The Buddha then sent him his image and told him to keep up the meditation
  this way. The monk attained the arahantship and escaped the King of Death forever.
47: By "flowers" are meant the pleasures of the senses here. One, who only keeps "gathering
  flowers", or in other words chase after the sense-pleasures, will be carried away
  by death, as the army of the king of Kosala in this story. King Pasenadi of Kosala
  asked the clan of the Sākyans (Buddha's own relatives) to give him one of their
  daughters as a wife. But they sent him a daughter of a slave woman by king Mahānāma.
  Pasenadi did not know that and married her. She gave birth to a son, who was named
  Vidudabha. Later Vidudabha found out, that his mother was a daughter of a slave
  and became very angry with the Sākyans. When he became the king, he declared war
  on them and killed almost all of the Sākyan clan. On the way back, he and his army
  encamped on the bank of a river. That night, heavy rain fell; the river swelled
  and carried Vidudabha and his army to the ocean. When Buddha heard what happened,
  he uttered this verse.
48: In the city of Sāvatthi there lived a woman named Pati Pujikā Kumāri. She was
  very generous and virtuous. She gave alms to everyone in need and generally helped
  everybody. She also remembered her one previous life. She used to be one of the
  wives of the God Mālabhāri in the Tāvatimsa heaven. So she would often pray that
  she might be born there again in her next life. One day she fell ill and passed
  away. And she was really reborn in the Tāvatimsa heaven. The other gods did not
  even miss her, because one hundred years in the human world is just one day in Tāvatimsa.
  So they asked her, where had she been the whole morning. She then told them the
  whole story. When the Buddha heard, that Pati Pujikā died, he explained that the
  life was very brief. Before the beings could be satisfied in the pleasures of the
  senses, they would be overpowered by death.
49: This verse talks about the practice of alms-rounds. The monks are supposed to
  obtain alms food from the people, going house from house and taking something here,
  something there, especially from those, who have a lot. Just like a bee takes the
  juice from the flower but does no harm to it, so the monks should get the food from
  the villagers, making no harm to them by taking too much from one family or from
  the poor families. The following story is associated with this verse. In one village
  there lived a very rich but very miserly couple. One day they made some pancakes,
  but because they did not want to share them with others, they made them secretly.
  The Buddha saw this and sent one of his chief disciples, Moggallāna to their house.
  He arrived there and stood by the door. They tried to make a very small pancake
  and give it to him. But no matter how they tried, a small amount of dough would
  fill in the whole pan. Then they tried to offer him one of their own pancakes, but
  they were unable to separate them. So they gave him the whole basket with all their
  pancakes. Moggallāna invited them to the monastery to see the Buddha. They offered
  the pancakes to the Buddha and the monks. The Buddha delivered a discourse on charity
  and both the husband and wife attained the first stage of Awakenment.
50: In Sāvatthi once lived a lady who was a disciple of the ascetic Pāthika. All her
  friends and neighbors were the disciples of the Buddha and she often wanted to go
  to the monastery herself, to hear the Buddha's teachings. But Pāthika always prevented
  her from going there. So she invited the Buddha to her house for almsgiving instead.
  He came together with many monks and after the meal he delivered a teaching. She
  was very impressed and happy and exclaimed, "Well said!" Pāthika heard this from
  the next room and became very angry. He left the house, cursing the woman and the
  Buddha. The lady was very embarrassed by this. But the Buddha advised her not to
  be concerned about others' curses, but to be only mindful of her own good and bad
  deeds. At the end she attained the first stage of Awakenment.
51: A certain Buddha's disciple named Chattapāni has attained the second stage of
  Awakenment. Once, while he was listening to the Buddha's discourse, the king Pasenadi
  came to the monastery. Chattapāni did not get up, because by paying homage to the
  king he would disrespect the Buddha. The king was very unhappy about that, thinking
  that Chattapāni offended him. But the Buddha explained to the king what Chattapāni
  meant. The king was impressed and asked Chattapāni to teach Dharma to his queens.
  But he refused, saying that monks should teach Dharma, not mere lay disciples. The
  Buddha then assigned Ānanda to teach them. After some time the Buddha asked, how
  much progress did the queens make. Ānanda replied, that the queen Mallikā was learning
  very quickly and seriously, the queen Vāsabha Khattiyā was not paying attention
  and therefore made no progress. The Buddha replied by this verse, saying that only
  those, who learn diligently and then practice what they learned, can benefit from
  the Dharma.
52: The story for this verse is the same as for the previous one. One who speaks well,
  who often admonishes others, but does not act according to one’s own speech speaks
  in vain. His words are just as a beautiful flower that does not smell. Only when
  one acts as well as one speak, one's speech can be considered well said, like a
  nice flower that also smells nicely.
53: 'The traditional commentary for this verse contains the famous story of the chief
  Buddha''s benefactress Visākhā. She married Punnavaddhana, the son of Migāra, a
  rich man who lived in the city of Sāvatthi. Once, when her father-in-law was eating
  his lunch, a monk came to their house on his alms-round. Migāra ignored him completely.
  Visākhā told the monk: "Sorry, venerable sir, my father-in-law only eats stale food".
  Migāra became very angry with her. She explained, that he was only reaping rewards
  of his good deeds from previous lives, not creating any merit in this life. Therefore
  she spoke about "stale food". Migāra understood and allowed her to invite the Buddha
  with the monks for the alms-food. Migāra listened to Buddha''s discourse from behind
  a curtain (because he was a lay disciple of some ascetic teacher and he did not
  want Migāra to show himself in front of the Buddha). After hearing Buddha''s speech,
  Migāra attained the first stage of Awakenment. He was very grateful to Visākhā and
  declared that she would be like a mother to him. Once she went to the monastery
  and carried her gem-entrusted cloak with her. She gave it to her maid to carry and
  she forgot it in the monastery. Visākhā then wanted to donate the cloak to the monks
  but they would not accept. So Visākhā tried to sell the cloak and donate the money
  for the use of the Sangha. But the cloak was so expensive that nobody could afford
  to buy it. Visākhā then bought it back herself. With the money she built a monastery
  for the Sangha. Visākhā was very happy - all her desires were fulfilled. The Buddha
  explained that she was strongly inclined to do good deeds, had done much good in
  the past and will do a lot of good deeds in the future - just as one can do many
  garlands from the heap of flowers.'
54: Venerable Ānanda was once sitting in meditation and he was pondering the problem
  of scent. All the known scents - perfumes, flowers, roots etc. go only with the
  wind. No scent can go against the wind. Is there any scent at all that can go against
  the wind? He asked the Buddha about it. The Buddha said that there exists such thing.
  A person, who takes refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, observes the moral
  precepts and is generous, is really worthy of praise. The "scent", or the reputation,
  of such a person spreads far and wide, with the wind and against it. Such a person
  is famous everywhere and people praise him.
55: The story for this verse is identical with that for the previous verse (DhP 54).
  The "scent" or reputation of virtue is the highest. All the other natural scents
  cannot compete with it, because they can be smelt only for a short time and only
  in a short distance. But the smell of virtue can be felt for a long period of time
  and in all directions.
56: One of the Buddha's chief disciples, Venerable Kassapa, went to the city of Rājagaha
  for alms food. He wanted to give some poor man opportunity to give him food and
  thus obtain merit. Sakka, the king of the gods saw this, he assumed the form of
  an old poor weaver and together with his wife Sujātā came to Rājagaha. Venerable
  Kassapa stood at their door and Sakka filled his bowl with delicious rice and curry.
  Kassapa thought, that this cannot be a poor man - how could such a person afford
  so delicious food? Kassapa then realized that this man and his wife are actually
  Sakka and Sujātā. They admitted this fact and told Kassapa that they were too very
  poor - they did not have enough opportunity to give alms and thus did not accumulate
  any merit. Monks asked the Buddha how Sakka knew Kassapa was such a virtuous person
  that any alms given to him reap great meritorious reward. The Buddha answered by
  this verse, telling them that the fame of Kassapa's virtue reached even amongst
  the gods.
57: A monk named Godhika was practicing meditation diligently. But whenever he made
  some progress in his meditation, he became seriously ill. It impaired effectiveness
  of his meditation, but he nevertheless continued to practice. At the end he decided
  to strive for the arahantship even if he were to die. So he concentrated on physical
  pain as his meditation object and cut his throat (this can nor be considered a suicide,
  because he was very close to arahantship anyway and he already eradicated all cravings).
  Thus, concentrating on the pain, he attained his goal and then passed away. Mara
  tried to find where Godhika was reborn but he could not find him anywhere. So he
  went and asked the Buddha about Godhika. The Buddha told him, that Godhika became
  an arahant and Mara could never be able to find him again.
58: In the city of Sāvatthi, there lived two friends, Sirigutta and Garahadinna. Sirigutta
  was a student of the Buddha and Garahadinna followed Nigantha's teaching. Garahadinna
  always instigated his friend to become a Nigantha's follower too. He would boast
  that his teachers know all the past, present and future. So Sirigutta once invited
  his friend's teachers to his house. He prepared a deep hole, filled it with dirt
  and put the seats on ropes on top of this trench. Niganthas came and when they sat
  down, the ropes broke and Niganthas fell into the pit. Sirigutta asked them how
  come they claim to know the future but they did not know what would happen to them.
  They did not know what to say and fled in terror. Garahadinna wanted to take revenge
  on his friend's teacher too, so he invited the Buddha and some monks to his house
  for alms food. He dug a hole, filled it with burning coal, and covered with mats.
  But when the Buddha entered and sat down, the coal disappeared and instead of it
  big lotus flowers appeared. Garahadinna was very alarmed. Then he realized that
  as he did not expect the Buddha to survive this test, he did not prepare any food.
  But when he entered the kitchen, he found out that a lot of food appeared there
  as if from nowhere. So he served the food to the Buddha and the monks. After the
  lunch, the Buddha taught the two friends Dharma in a gradual manner. At the end
  they both attained the first stage of Awakenment.
59: The story to this verse is identical to the previous one. Just as a lotus can
  grow in a dirty place, but does not become stained by it, so a true disciple of
  the Buddha lives in this world, but is not dirtied by it in any way.
60: King Pasenadi of Kosala once saw a beautiful woman in the city. He instantly fell
  in love with her. He found out that she was already married and so he gave her husband
  a job in the palace. Then the king sent the young man on an impossible mission.
  He told him to collect some lotus flowers and red earth from the underground world
  and to return to the city the same day. He thought of course that the man will never
  complete the task and so will never dare to come back. Thus the king could take
  the wife to himself. The young man set out on his mission. On the way he shared
  his food with some traveler. Then he threw the rest of the food to the river and
  called the guardian spirits, telling them that he shares with them his merit obtained
  from sharing the food with others. The guardian spirit of the river then brought
  him the flowers and earth from the underworld. The young man returned to the city
  only to find the gates closed. The king had the city gates closed early in fear
  that the man will complete the task in time. So he put the flowers and earth on
  the ground, declared loudly that his mission is complete and went for the night
  to the monastery of Jetavana. The king was obsessed with his desire for the young
  woman, so he could not sleep that night. He heard some strange sounds. In the morning
  he went to see the Buddha about them. The Buddha told him that the sounds he heard
  came from the men who desired others' wives and now suffer in hell. The king realized
  foolishness of his actions and reflected that now he knows how long is the night
  for the sleepless. Also the young man realized how long is the journey for one who
  is tired. The Buddha told them by this verse that longest is the Samsara for those
  who are foolish and do not know the Dharma.
61: Venerable Mahākassapa was once staying near Rājagaha. At that time he had two
  novices with him. One of them was very good, diligent, respectful and obedient whereas
  the other one was lazy, disrespectful and naughty. When Kassapa admonished the bad
  novice, he became angry. One day he went to the village to get some food and lied
  that Kassapa was sick. So the people gave him very good food for Venerable Kassapa.
  But the novice ate all himself and came back to Kassapa empty-handed. He was admonished
  once again, but instead of repenting he became even angrier. The next day when Kassapa
  left for his alms-round, the young novice broke all things and set fire to the monastery.
  When the Buddha heard about this he spoke this verse, remarking that it would be
  better for Kassapa to live alone than to associate himself with such a fool.
62: In the city of Sāvatthi there once lived a rich but very stingy man. He was extremely
  wealthy but he did not give anything away in charity. Before he died, he buried
  five pots of gold in the garden, but he did not tell his son about it. He was born
  again in a village of beggars close to Sāvatthi. Since the time his mother became
  pregnant with him, the income of beggars decreased dramatically. They decided, that
  the boy must be unlucky, so they drove his mother and him from the village. So they
  begged on themselves. Whenever she went begging by herself, she would get as much
  as before, but when she took the boy with her, she got nothing. So when the boy
  grew up, his mother sent him out alone to beg. He wandered about in Sāvatthi and
  he entered his old house. His former son were frightened by him and ordered him
  to be thrown out of the house. The Buddha happened to see this incident and he told
  him that the young beggar was nobody else but his own dead father. The son did not
  believe it, so the Buddha ordered the boy to reveal where he buried the gold. Only
  then did his son accept the truth and he became a disciple of the Buddha.
63: 'A group of Buddha''s followers once went to the monastery to hear the Dharma.
  Two thieves joined them. One of them was busy stealing from the devotees, so he
  did not pay any attention to what the Buddha was saying. The other one listened
  and soon he understood the Dharma and stopped stealing. When they returned home,
  the first thief laughed at the second one: "You are so stupid, you did not bring
  back anything! I am very wise, because I stole a lot of things." The other thief
  then went to the Buddha and told him what happened. The Buddha explained by this
  verse that the fool who knows that he is a fool is wise at least to that extent,
  whereas the fool who thinks that he is wise can be truly called a fool.'
64: There was a monk named Udāyi, who was very ignorant. He used to sit on the platform
  from which the best teachers delivered the discourses. Once a group of traveling
  monks took him for a learned monk and gave him some questions on the Dharma. But
  Udāyi could not answer, because he actually did not know anything about the Dharma.
  The monks were surprised that somebody can stay close to the Buddha for such a long
  time and still know so very little. The Buddha explained by this verse that although
  a fool associates with somebody wise even for whole his life, he still does not
  realize the Dharma, just as a spoon can never taste the soup, although it is used
  it for eating the very soup.
65: In the city of Pāveyyaka there lived a group of young friends. Once they went
  to a forest and took a courtesan with them. While they were resting, the courtesan
  ran away with their money. While they searched for her in the forest, they met the
  Buddha. They stopped looking for the woman and listened to the Buddha's teachings.
  Immediately they all became monks and followed the Buddha to the monastery. They
  all practiced very diligently and soon (when the Buddha was delivering one of the
  discourses), they all became Arahants. Some other monks were surprised, how is it
  possible to attain the arahantship so quickly. The Buddha explained by this verse,
  that an intelligent person could quickly realize the Dharma although he is associated
  with a wise person only for a very short time - just as the tongue tastes the soup.
66: 'There was a man named Suppabuddha. In one of his previous existences he killed
  a courtesan and she vowed a revenge on him. In yet another existence he spat on
  a holy man. As a result of these actions he was born as a leper. Once he listened
  to the Buddha''s discourse. He very quickly realized the Dharma and followed the
  Buddha to the monastery. Sakka, the king of gods, wanted to test him and so he appeared
  in front of him and told him: "You are only a poor man. If you renounce the Buddha,
  I will give you all the wealth of the world." But Suppabuddha replied, that he was
  actually an extremely rich man - having the faith in the Buddha and his teaching.
  Then Sakka related the story to the Buddha, who said that a hundred Sakkas could
  not turn Suppabuddha of the right path. Suppabuddha then went to see the Buddha
  and on the way back from the monastery an evil spirit - the woman whom he killed
  in a previous existence - killed him. The monks asked the Buddha where was Suppabuddha
  reborn and the Buddha told them, that he had been reborn in Tāvatimsa heaven. By
  doing bad deeds over the period of several lives he accumulated a lot of defilements.
  These caused him so much pain and suffering, but his realizing the Dharma has cleared
  them away.'
67: 'Some thieves were once dividing the stolen goods amongst themselves in the field.
  But accidentally, they left one bag of money behind. Then a farmer from a nearby
  village started to plough that very field. The Buddha accompanied by Venerable Ānanda
  went by and the Buddha said: "Ānanda, look at that poisonous snake!" To which Ānanda
  replied: "Yes, Venerable Sir, it indeed is a very poisonous snake." The farmer was
  very curious so he went to investigate. He found the bag with money and took it
  with him. Then the people who were robbed came to that place, followed the footprints
  of the farmer and found their money. They took the farmer to the king who ordered
  him executed. But on the way to the cemetery the poor man was constantly repeating
  the Buddha and Ānanda''s words. The executioners were surprised, so they took him
  back to see the king. The king then brought the farmer to the presence of the Buddha.
  After hearing what happened that morning, the king set the farmer free and remarked
  that if the farmer were not able to call the Buddha as his witness, he would have
  been killed. To that the Buddha replied with this verse, saying that a wise man
  should not do anything he could regret later.'
68: In the city of Rājagaha there lived a florist named Sumana. His duty was to bring
  the king Bimbisāra fresh jasmine flowers every morning. One day he was on his way
  to the palace with the flowers, when he saw the Buddha and many monks on their alms
  round. He felt a strong desire to offer the flowers to the Buddha. He decided that
  even if the king were to fire him or even kill him, he would offer the flowers to
  the Buddha. He did so and was filled with delightful satisfaction. When Bimbisāra
  heard about it, he was extremely happy with what Sumana have done. He praised him
  for his devotion and gave him a big reward. Venerable Ānanda asked the Buddha what
  consequences would Sumana bear for this action. The Buddha replied that Sumana would
  not be reborn any more in any of the lower worlds and that he will attain arahantship
  in the near future.
69: In the city of Sāvatthi lived a beautiful girl named Uppalavaṇṇā. The news of
  her beauty traveled very far and she had many suitors from near and afar. Amongst
  them was her cousin Nanda who fell in love with her hopelessly. But she decided
  not to marry any of them and became a nun instead. One day after lightening a lamp
  she kept her mind fixed on the flame as her object of meditation and she attained
  arahantship. Later she moved to the forest and lived in solitude. Once Nanda came
  to her hut when she was not there and hid under the couch. He was determined to
  take her by force if she did not agree to marry him. Uppalavaṇṇā returned and he
  jumped up. She tried to warn him, told him that he would have to bear consequences
  for his actions, but he did not listen and raped her. For this he indeed had to
  suffer a long period of time. When the Buddha heard about this, he told King Pasenadi
  of Kosala about the dangers that nuns living by themselves in the forest had to
  face. The king built a monastery within the city and from that time on the nuns
  lived only in the city.
70: In the city of Sāvatthi there lived a young man of a rich family. His name was
  Jambuka. He had very strange habits. He would sleep only on the floor and eat his
  own excrements. When he grew up, his parents sent him to the ascetics. But even
  those ascetics felt his habits were too disgusting so they sent him away. After
  that he lived alone in the forest. During the day he would stay on one leg (as he
  said, he was to heavy for the earth to bear him) and with his mouth open (he boasted
  that he lived only on air). He also used to say that he never sits down and never
  sleeps. But at night he slept on the floor and ate his own excrements. Many people
  started to count themselves as his followers; they would bring him food and gifts.
  But he did not take anything, only sometimes he would take a little bit of food
  and eat it with the tip of the kusa grass, which was quite common practice for ascetics.
  Thus he lived many years. Once the Buddha came to where he was staying and asked
  for a place to spend the night. Jambuka let him sleep in the nearby cave. At night,
  many gods and supernatural beings came to pay homage to the Buddha. Jambuka saw
  this and asked the Buddha what happened. When the Buddha told him that these beings
  were gods, Jambuka was impressed. He told the Buddha that he must be a very holy
  person, because although he himself spent years standing on one leg and eating only
  air, no god ever came to pay homage to him. The Buddha told him that he could not
  be fooled. He said that he knew very well that Jambuka slept on the ground every
  night and ate his excrements. The Buddha also explained, that during one of his
  previous existences Jambuka had prevented a certain monk to go obtain alms food
  and how he threw away the food that was sent with him for that very monk. As a result
  of these actions he was born with these strange habits. Jambuka realized his mistakes
  and paid respects to the Buddha. The Buddha delivered a discourse, at the end of
  which Jambuka attained arahantship and became one of the Buddha's monks. When Jambuka's
  followers arrived they were surprised to see their teacher with the Buddha. Jambuka
  announced that he was now a member of Buddha's Sangha, the Order and a disciple
  of the Buddha. The Buddha explained that the cruelest austerities practiced for
  a long period of time are not worth even one-sixteenth of understanding of the true
  Dharma.
71: Once the Venerable Moggallāna with Venerable Lakkhana were on alms round in the
  city of Rājagaha. Suddenly Venerable Moggallāna smiled but did not say anything.
  When they returned to the monastery, Lakkhana asked why he smiled. Moggallāna explained,
  that he saw a peta-ghost in the village. The Buddha then said that he himself saw
  that very peta on the day he attained awakenment. In one of his previous existences
  it was a rich landowner. There lived an Individual Buddha (Paccekabuddha) close
  to one of his fields. People who went to pay their respects to this Buddha had to
  pass through his field. He feared that this would damage the field and so he set
  fire to it. So the Buddha had to move to some other place. Because of this evil
  deed he was reborn as a peta-ghost. At the end the Buddha spoke this verse, saying
  that although at the time of the evil action it may seem there are no consequences,
  they will surely come in the future. Because we cannot see the fire through the
  ashes it is covered with, does not mean there is no fire at all.
72: Venerable Moggallāna once saw a peta-ghost on one of his alms rounds. The Buddha
  then related the story about this particular ghost. He said, that a long time ago
  he was a man very skilful in throwing stones. He studied this art for a long time
  and then he asked his teacher for permission to try his skills. His teacher warned
  him not to hit cows or people - he would have to pay compensations to the owner
  of the cow or the relatives of that person. This foolish man then went out and saw
  a holy man. Since the holy man had no relatives, he thought that this would be a
  good practice target. So he threw stones at the holy man and killed him. The public
  then became very angry and killed the man in turn. Besides, he was reborn many times
  in very miserable states. In this present existence, he was reborn as a peta-ghost
  whose head was being hit with hot hammers. The Buddha then explained by this verse
  that a fool gains knowledge only for his misfortune, because he does not know how
  to use it properly and certainly it will cause him some harm.
73: A householder named Citta once met Venerable Mahānāma, one of the first Buddha's
  disciples. When listening to the discourse given by him, Citta realized the Dharma.
  Therefore, he built a monastery in his mango grove and installed a monk named Sudhamma
  as the resident monk. On day, Venerable Moggallāna and Venerable Sāriputta came
  to the monastery. They gave a discourse and after hearing it, Citta attained the
  third stage of Awakenment. He then invited Moggallāna and Sāriputta to his house
  for alms food the next day. After that he also invited Sudhamma, but he refused,
  saying that he was invited only after the other two were. Citta repeated his invitation,
  but Sudhamma again turned it down. But the next day Sudhamma came to the Citta's
  house nevertheless. He was invited inside, but he refused, saying that he was on
  his alms round. But when he saw tasty food being prepared for Moggallāna and Sāriputta
  he got envious and angry. He told Citta that he did not want to live in his monastery
  any longer. Sudhamma then reported to the Buddha what happened. The Buddha told
  him, "You have offended a faithful and generous lay disciple. You must go back and
  apologize for your mistake!" Sudhamma did so, but Citta felt that he still did not
  realize his mistake fully and refused his apology. Sudhamma went back to the Buddha,
  who admonished him with this verse (and the following one, see DhP 74). He said,
  "You should not be attached to this or that dwelling, to this or that lay disciple
  - in this way the pride and envy will increase." Sudhamma went back to the Citta's
  house and this time Citta accepted the apology. Not long after that, Sudhamma attained
  Arahantship.
74: The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous one, as
  they actually form two parts of one rather long verse (see DhP 73). As with the
  monk Sudhamma in the story, if we become too attached to our surroundings, if we
  identify ourselves with it, our desires will grow. If we feel that only we know
  how to do things and if we expect everybody to follow our leadership in whatever
  has to be done, our pride will only increase. Needles to say, desire and pride are
  hindrances on the way to Awakenment.
75: In the city of Sāvatthi lived a well-known man. He often offered alms food to
  the monks and especially to Venerable Sāriputta. He had a son named Tissa. At the
  age of seven, the young boy Tissa became a novice under Sāriputta. While living
  at the Jetavana monastery, relatives would visit him often and bring him many presents.
  Soon he was tired of these visits so he took a subject of meditation from the Buddha
  and moved away to the forest monastery. While there, he devoted himself to meditation.
  Whenever villagers offered him alms, he said just, "May you be well and happy!"
  After three months of meditation he attained arahantship. Then Venerable Sāriputta,
  Moggallāna, and other senior monks paid visit to Tissa. Villagers requested Sāriputta
  to deliver a discourse, but he let speak Tissa instead. Villagers were not pleased,
  because they never heard anything from Tissa except for the words "May you be well
  and happy!" They thought he did not really understand Dharma. But Tissa gave a discourse
  and spoke for the whole night. Villagers were impressed and felt lucky that they
  have such a wise monk with them. But still they were a bit angry with him for not
  speaking earlier. Then the Buddha came to the village and told the villagers how
  lucky they were. If it was not for Tissa, would they all, the Buddha and so many
  senior monks, come to the village? The villagers realized their luck and did not
  think about the past any more.
76: A poor old man named Rādha was staying in the monastery doing manual work, like
  sweeping, cutting the grass etc. He wanted to become a monk, but the elders were
  not willing to admit him. One day the Buddha saw that Rādha had a potential to become
  an arahant, so he called the monks and asked them if any of them recollects a good
  deed done by Rādha. Venerable Sāriputta said that Rādha once offered him some rice.
  The Buddha then asked if it wasn't proper to repay the kindness by accepting the
  man into the Order and show him the way out of suffering. So Rādha became a monk
  under Venerable Sāriputta. He strictly followed Sāriputta's guidance and in a very
  short time he attained arahantship. When the Buddha heard about this he explained
  by this verse that a monk should always be attentive to guidance by his betters
  and not resent rebukes for his faults.
77: There were two monks, Assaji and Punabhasuka, staying in the village of Kitāgiri
  together with their disciples. They planted trees for personal gain and violated
  some other minor monks' precepts. Thus, the monastery became noisy and not suitable
  for spiritual development. When the Buddha heard about it, he sent Sāriputta and
  Moggallāna to advise these monks. After the admonition from the two Buddha's chief
  disciples, most of the monks changed their way of life. But some of them were not
  happy and returned to the household life. The Buddha reacted with this verse, saying
  that admonishing and instructing is always fine with the good ones, whereas the
  bad ones never agree to being advised.
78: Channa was Prince Siddhattha's servant before he renounced the world. When he
  left the palace and went to homelessness, Channa accompanied him part of the way.
  After he became the Buddha, Channa also left the worldly life and became a monk.
  But on account of his close connection with the Buddha, he was very proud and arrogant.
  He used to scold Sāriputta and Moggallāna, envying them their positions as two Buddha's
  chief disciples. The Buddha admonished him several times, but Channa still continued
  to abuse as before. This went on for a long time. Just before the Buddha passed
  away, he told Ānanda that after his death, a special punishment should be imposed
  on Channa - nobody was to talk to him, nobody was to associate with him. When Channa
  learned about this, he felt a deep remorse for his behavior. He admitted his mistake
  and apologized. After that he changed his ways, practiced diligently and soon he
  became an Arahant.
79: 'King Mahākappina ruled in Kukkutavati. Once he heard from some merchants about
  the Buddha and his teachings. He and several of his ministers immediately left for
  Sāvatthi, where the Buddha was staying at that time. They met the Buddha sitting
  under a tree on the bank of a river. After listening to his teachings, they immediately
  realized the Dharma and became monks. When he did not return, his queen and wives
  of the ministers followed them to Sāvatthi. When they arrived there, the Buddha
  hid the former king and his ministers, because he knew that if the women saw their
  husbands in yellow robes and with their heads shaved, it would be impossible for
  them to realize the Dharma. So he just told them to sit down and listen to what
  he had to say, their husbands would join them soon. He then delivered a discourse.
  At the end the king and his ministers (they were sitting nearby) attained arahantship
  and the queen and the wives of the ministers attained the first stage of awakenment.
  The ladies also joined the Order and soon became arahants too. Venerable Mahākappina
  would often exclaim: "Oh, what happiness!" When the other monks asked the Buddha
  what he meant, he replied with this verse, explaining that Mahākappina tasted the
  nectar of the Dharma and found it extremely sweet. He therefore lives happily, with
  a bright mind.'
80: Venerable Sāriputta once had a very young novice. On the eighth day after becoming
  a novice he was with Sāriputta on an alms-round. He observed irrigators irrigating
  the fields, arrow-makers making their arrows and carpenters working with wood. He
  asked Venerable Sāriputta if those things, which have no mind, could be guided to
  wherever one wishes. Sāriputta replied that it is so. The young novice then thought,
  "If those things, which have no mind, could be guided to wherever one wishes, then
  why could not I master myself?" He then asked permission from Sāriputta, returned
  to the monastery and diligently practiced. Very soon he attained the third stage
  of awakenment and was very close to attaining full arahantship. Sāriputta then returned
  and was going towards the novice's hut. The Buddha saw this and he also saw that
  the novice was just about to attain the goal, so he met Sāriputta outside and prevented
  him from going to the novice's hut by asking him various questions. The novice indeed
  attained arahantship very soon and the Buddha explained that the reason, why he
  kept Sāriputta outside, was to enable the young novice to attain his goal without
  being interrupted.
81: At the Jetavana monastery lived a monk named Bhaddiya. Because he was very short,
  other monks would often tease him. Younger monks would pull his nose or pat him
  on the head and ask, "Uncle, how are you? Are you bored with your life as a monk?"But
  Bhaddiya was extremely good-natured and he never retaliated in anger. Somebody once
  mentioned Bhaddiya's patience in front of the Buddha. The Buddha replied by this
  verse and he added, that Arahants are like that - they never loose temper for whatever
  reason. They are like mountain rocks - unmovable by the "wind" of praise or blame.
  Only then did the other monks understand, that this funny short Bhaddiya was actually
  an Arahant.
82: In one village there lived a woman named Kāṇa Mātā. She was a devout lay disciple
  of the Buddha. She had a daughter Kāṇa who was married to a man from another village.
  Once she was staying with her mother and her husband sent for her. But her mother
  told her to wait, because she wanted to send some cakes to her husband. But the
  next day some monks came to the house and Kāṇa Mātā gave the cakes to them. Kāṇa
  had to wait for her mother to prepare new cakes and she could not return to her
  husband. This happened every day for three following days. All the cakes were given
  to the monks. Kāṇa's husband then took another wife. Kāṇa accused the monks that
  they have ruined her marriage and became very bitter. She would insult and abuse
  the monks, wherever she saw them. The Buddha then set a new rule for the monks,
  not to take advantage of the devotion of the lay disciples. He went to Kāṇa Mātā's
  house and asked Kāṇa if the monks took what was given or what was not given. Kāṇa
  replied that they took only what was given to them and realized that she was wrong.
  The Buddha then gave a discourse. At the end, Kāṇa attained the first stage of Arahantship.
  King Pasenadi of Kosala heard about this, summoned Kāṇa to the palace and one of
  his ministers adopted her as his daughter. Every day she gave offerings to holy
  people who came to her door. The Buddha then noted that Kāṇa's mind, originally
  confused and "muddy" became clear as a lake after listening to the Dharma.
83: The Buddha and many monks once stayed for the Rain Retreat in the village of Veranja
  at a request of a Brahmin from that village. But for some reason the Brahmin did
  not look after them. Moreover, there was a famine in the region and people could
  not support them very well. But the monks were all contented and happy. Some horse
  traders offered them grain every day and they lived on that food and continued to
  practice meditation diligently. When the Rains were over, the Buddha and the monks
  returned to Savatthi. At that time, a certain group of people was permitted to stay
  in the monastery. They only ate greedily, slept and played on the bank of the river.
  There was a lot of noise in the monastery and around it. When monks remarked to
  the Buddha that people were so depressed during the famine and now, when it was
  over, they were so elated. The Buddha replied with this verse, adding that only
  the foolish are full of sorrow when things do not go well and extremely happy when
  everything is fine. The wise is always calm and equanimous whether they have to
  face good or bad things.
84: In the city of Savatthi, there lived a man with his pregnant wife. He wanted to
  become a monk so he asked his wife for permission. She told him to wait after the
  baby is born. When it happened, she again asked him to stay until the child could
  walk. When the man finally got to be a monk, he took a subject of meditation, practiced
  diligently and soon attained arahantship. A few years later he visited his house
  in order to teach Dharma to his family. His son became a monk too and soon he also
  became an Arahant. The wife thought, "If both my husband and my son entered the
  Order, I'd better go too." So she left the house and became a nun. Eventually she
  too attained arahantship. The Buddha was told how the whole family attained arahantship
  and he replied by this verse. He added, that a wise man works for his liberation
  and helps others towards the same goal. The awakenment can be realized only after
  much effort.
85: One day, a group of people came to the monastery to give offerings to the monks
  and listen to the discourses. It was arranged that they could stay the whole night
  and listen to the monks explaining the Dharma. But some of them did not have enough
  energy and they returned home early. Some stayed for the night, but were sleepy
  and did not pay much attention to what was being said. Only a few were able to listen
  attentively to the discourses. In the morning the Buddha was told about what happened.
  He replied by this verse, saying that most people are too attached to this world,
  only a few are able to reach the other shore and attain Nirvana. He reminded the
  monks to strive diligently for the goal; only those who will do se will be able
  to reach the perfection of mind.
86: The story for this verse is identical to the story for the previous one. It is
  not easy to reach the Nirvana, even if we practice diligently for a long time. Most
  people, although they listen to the discourses, read books and meditate, are not
  able to really cut the ties to "this shore" and realize the arahantship. Only when
  one is really living the Dharma for a long time and fully, one is able to achieve
  this goal.
87: A group of monks came to see the Buddha and asked him for advice on meditation.
  The Buddha advised them with this verse and with the two following ones (DhP 88,
  DhP 89). In order to be able to devote oneself completely to the practice of meditation,
  one must "give up the bad states". These are evil deeds, evil thoughts. Then one
  must develop "good states", or good deeds and good thoughts. If one wants to practice
  wholeheartedly, it is very good to "go the houselessness", or in other words to
  became a monk or a nun and meditate diligently in solitude. That is extremely difficult,
  because in solitude there is nothing "to enjoy", nothing for our mind to occupy
  itself with, we are left only with ourselves and have to concentrate on the practice.
88: A group of monks came to see the Buddha and asked him for advice on meditation.
  The Buddha advised them with this verse and with the preceding and the following
  one (DhP 87, DhP 89). In order to reach the awakenment, one must abandon all cravings
  and "have nothing", or in other words, not cling to anything. One must also purify
  the mind from the "impurities", or greed, hate, delusion, conceit, speculative views,
  skeptical doubt, mental torpor, restlessness, shamelessness and lack of moral dread.
  This way, one will reach the state of arahantship and then one can truly find delight
  in solitude.
89: 'A group of monks came to see the Buddha and asked him for advice on meditation.
  The Buddha advised them with this verse and with the two preceeding ones (DhP 87,
  DhP 88). In order to reach the awakenment, one must fully develop the "constituents
  of awakenment". They are seven: mindfulness (sati), investigation of the Dharma
  (dhammavicaya), energy (viriya), joy (piti), tranquility (passadhi), concentration
  (samadhi) and equanimity (upekkha). We also must not cling to anything and take
  delight in renouncing all the attachments. Most importantly, we must "remove the
  taints". Traditionally, these four taints (asava) are mentioned in the texts: sense
  desire (kama), desiring eternal existence (bhava), wrong views (ditthi) and ignorance
  (avijja). If we remove these taints, we will "shine" with wisdom and be truly completely
  emancipated from the suffering.'
90: Devadatta once tried to kill the Buddha by pushing a big rock on him from the
  top of the mountain. But the rock split and only one splinter hurt the Buddha's
  foot. The physician Jivaka attended on him. He applied some medicine and promised
  to come back and take the bandage off in the evening. But he was held by some other
  business and the city gates were already closed when he wanted to go to the monastery.
  He knew that the bandage had to be taken off that night, so he was very distressed.
  The next morning, Jivaka hurried to see the Buddha, only to find out that Venerable
  Ananda helped the Buddha to take the bandage off the previous night and the wound
  has already healed completely! So Jivaka asked if the Buddha felt any pain. The
  Buddha replied by this verse, saying that for those, who have reached the awakenment,
  there was no pain.
91: The Buddha once spent the Rain Retreat in the city of Rajagaha. With the end of
  the retreat he was getting ready to leave the city, so he told the monks to prepare
  for the journey. Venerable Kassapa was also preparing his robes. Some monks speculated
  if Kassapa would really leave Rajagaha - there were so many people who respected
  him very much and considered themselves his disciples. The Buddha then decided that
  some monks should stay in Rajagaha, to offer spiritual guidance, to ordain new monks
  etc. He told Venerable Kassapa to stay in the monastery with some junior monks and
  take care of these things. The other monks remarked that they predicted Kassapa
  would not accompany the Buddha this time. The Buddha overheard these conversations
  and said, "Do you think that Kassapa stays in Rajagaha because he is attached to
  his disciples? You are mistaken. Kassapa has no attachments anywhere!" He further
  added this verse.
92: Venerable Belatthi Sisa went on an almsround in a village. When he had enough
  food, he stopped on the way and ate. Then he continued on his almsround for more
  food. When he returned to the monastery, he dried the rice up and stored it. In
  this way he could concentrate only on his practice of meditation. Every day he would
  soak the rice in some water and eat it. The other monks saw this and thought that
  he is lazy and greedy. They reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha saw that
  if this practice became a habit amongst all monks, it could lead to laziness and
  greed and he discouraged the monks from hoarding food. But because Belatthi Sisa
  did not store the rice out of greed for food, but only to save time for more meditation
  practice, the Buddha declared that he should not be blamed in any way. He also added
  this verse, saying that the Arahants are not greedy for anything and they take food
  just to sustain the body in good condition, not for pleasure.
93: 'Venerable Anuruddha was once looking for discarded pieces of cloth in order to
  make himself a new robe. His wife Jalini from a previous existence, who was now
  a god, saw him. She brought three pieces of a very good material and put them on
  the rubbish heap. Venerable Anuruddha found them and took them back to the monastery
  to make his robe. The Buddha and other senior disciples then arrived to the monastery
  and they also helped him to make the robe. Jalini then urged the villagers to bring
  lots of delicious food to the monastery, so there was more than enough for everyone.
  Some monks remarked that Anuruddha wanted to show off that he had many devotees,
  so he made them to bring so much good food. The Buddha overheard these conversations
  and said that Anuruddha did not ask anyone for anything. Arahants do not ask for
  food or clothes. They have removed their taints and are free and without attachments.
  Traditionally, the four taints (asava) are mentioned in the texts: sense desire
  (kama), desiring eternal existence (bhava), wrong views (ditthi) and ignorance (avijja).'
94: One day Sakka, the chief of the gods, came to the monastery to pay homage to the
  Buddha. Venerable Maha Kaccayana was not in the monastery at that time and a seat
  was kept prepared for him. Sakka with the gods paid homage to the Buddha and then
  he declared his wish that Kaccayana would also be present so that he could pay homage
  also to him. At that moment Kaccayana arrived. Sakka was very happy and paid his
  respect to him. Some monks accused Sakka of favoritism. Bu the Buddha replied with
  this verse, saying that who is restrained in his senses, even gods envy him his
  calm and respect him enormously.
95: Once a certain monk approached the Buddha and complained, that Venerable Sariputta
  has abused and beaten him. The Buddha sent for Sariputta and asked him if it was
  true. Sariputta was extremely humble and replied, "I am like the earth, I feel no
  pleasure or pain, I am like a door mat, like a beggar, I am not attached to my body
  any more. How could I not apologize to a fellow monk for a wrong doing?" The monk
  felt remorse and admitted that he accused Sariputta wrongly, because he was angry
  with him for some small matter. He asked Sariputta for pardon. The Buddha advised
  Sariputta to accept the apology. Sariputta pardoned the monk and also asked him
  to be forgiven if he had done anything wrong. The Budha then spoke this verse, saying
  that an Arahant is like the earth, or like an Indra's stake - he is patient and
  firm, serene and pure like a clear lake.
96: Once a young seven years old boy became a novice under Venerable Tissa. While
  his head was being shaved, he kept his mind fixed on the object of meditation and
  attained arahantship immediately. After a time, Venerable Tissa and the young novice
  set out on a journey to Savatthi to see the Buddha. On the way they stayed in a
  village monastery. Tissa went to sleep, but the young novice fell asleep only before
  the dawn. When Tissa woke up, he wanted to wake up also the novice. So he roused
  him with a palm-leaf fan. Accidentally he hit his eye with the handle and damaged
  his eye. The novice did not say anything, covered his eye with one hand and performed
  his duties - swept the floor and brought water to Tissa. When Tissa saw the novice
  offering him water with just one hand, he remarked that he should do it with both
  hands. The novice uncovered his eye and only then Tissa found out that the novice
  lost an eye. He also realized that he must be an Arahant! He felt very sorry and
  immediately started to apologize to the boy. But the novice said it was not Tissa's
  fault, it was only ripening of his old karma. Tissa just could not forget the whole
  story and he felt very depressed. When they arrived in Savatthi, Tissa related the
  story to the Buddha. He replied with this verse, saying that an Arahant does not
  get angry with anyone, he is perfectly calm and peaceful.
97: A group of monks came from a village to pay their respects to the Buddha. The
  Buddha sent for Sariputta and asked him, "Sariputta, do you believe, that one can
  attain Nirvana by being mindful of the senses?" Sariputta replied, "I do not simply
  believe in this because I have faith on you and your teaching. Only those who have
  no personal experience accept the facts from others." The monks did not understand
  it and thought that Sariputta doesn't have faith in the Buddha, that he did not
  given up wrong views yet. The Buddha explained that Sariputta accepts the fact that
  Nirvana can be attained by being mindful of senses by his own personal experience,
  because he already attained arahantship. He does not simply trust blindly in his
  teacher's words without testing them with his own practice. Blind faith has no place
  in Buddhism, only the trust in the method, which must be followed by one's own personal
  experience.
98: Revata was the brother of Venerable Sariputta and he was the only one who has
  not become a monk. His parents wanted him to get married and so they arranged a
  marriage for him while he was still very young. At the wedding ceremony he saw a
  very old woman and realized that all beings are subject to old age, illness and
  eventually death. He was horrified and immediately left for the monastery. He was
  admitted into the Order and became a novice. He stayed alone in the forest, kept
  meditating diligently and very soon he attained arahantship. The Buddha, Sariputta
  and many other monks set out on a journey to visit him. The journey was long and
  the area was uninhabited by people, but gods looked to the needs of the Buddha and
  monks. When they arrived, Revata also used his supernatural powers and created a
  monastery for the Buddha and the monks to stay. The Buddha remarked that wherever
  the Arahant lives, the place is always beautiful and delightful.
99: A certain monk received a subject of meditation from the Buddha and went to an
  old garden at the outskirts of the city. Some lascivious woman came into the garden
  and as there was nobody else around she tried to seduce the monk. She unloosened
  her hair, began to undress and laugh. The monk became very excited and upset. He
  did not know what to do. The Buddha saw this from afar and told the monk this verse,
  saying that in seeking passions there is no delight. Only after freeing oneself
  from passion can one enjoy whatever place one is at. The monk did not care about
  the woman any more and attained arahantship quickly.
100: Once there was a former public executioner named Tambadathika. Once he went for
  a bath to the river and took some food with him. Just as he was leaving the house,
  Venerable Sariputta stopped by his door on his way for almsfood. Tambadathika offered
  him his food. After the meal, Sariputta taught him the Dharma. But Tambadathika's
  mind was not peaceful, because he was disturbed and feeling remorse recollecting
  his past work. This did not allow him to pay attention to the Dharma. Sariputta
  asked him if he killed those people because he wanted to, out of hate or anger –
  or was it just an order. Tambadathika replied that he was ordered to kill them by
  the king and personally did not feel hate towards them. So Sariputta reassured him
  that he did nothing wrong. Tambadathika then calmed down and listened to the Dharma
  attentively. He then accompanied Sariputta on the way back to the monastery. But
  on the way back home he died due to an accident. The Buddha was told about this
  and he remarked that Tambadathika was reborn in Tusita heaven. The monks wondered
  how it was possible for somebody who killed so many people in his life to be reborn
  there. The Buddha told them by this verse that just one meaningful sentence that
  helped his mind to calm down and concentrate on the Dharma helped him to achieve
  this goal. For if one dies with a peaceful mind, one's rebirth is good. If at the
  time of death our mind is confused or angry - we face a bad rebirth.
101: 'Some merchants sailed in a boat. Their boat was wrecked and only one of them,
  named Bahiya, survived. He got hold of a piece of wood and came to land in the city
  of Supparaka. He tied a piece of bark to his body and sat in a public place. People
  gave him food; some thought that he was a holy man so they paid their respects to
  him. Some people offered him clothes but he refused. Everybody started to tell him
  that he was an Arahant so he began to consider himself one. Now the god Brahma was
  a friend of Bahiya''s in one of previous lives. He came to see him one night and
  told him that he certainly was not an Arahant. Bahiya asked if there are Arahants
  at all and where to find them. Brahma sent him to the city of Savatthi to see the
  Buddha. Bahiya immediately set on a journey to Savatthi. He did not rest much because
  he was anxious to meet the Buddha. Therefore when he arrived at Savatthi he was
  extremely tired. He met the Buddha going on an almsround with some other monks.
  He asked the Buddha to teach him the Dharma, but the Buddha refused saying that
  it was not a proper time for a discourse. But Bahiya pleaded again and the Buddha
  realized that Bahiya is ready to become an Arahant. So he told him: "Bahiya, when
  you see a thing, be conscious only of the object. When you hear a sound, be conscious
  only of the sound. When you smell, taste, or touch anything, be conscious only of
  the smell, taste, or touch. When you think of anything, be conscious only of the
  mental object." Bahiya did this and immediately he attained Arahantship. He asked
  permission to be admitted into the Order as a monk. The Buddha agreed, but first
  he sent him to find some robes, the bowl and other requisites. Bahiya went to find
  these things, but on the way he was attacked by a wild animal and died. When the
  Buddha and monks went back from the almsround, they found him laying dead on the
  road. The Buddha instructed the monks to cremate Bahiya''s body and erect a stupa
  around the ashes. The Buddha then told the monks that Bahiya has attained Arahantship.
  He proclaimed that Bahiya was the quickest of all his disciples to do so. Some monks
  wondered how it was possible to attain Awakenment just after listening to a few
  words on the road. The Buddha then explained by this verse that the number of words
  or the length of the speech does not really matter if one''s mind is really ready.'
102: 'In the city of Rajagaha there lived a girl named Kundala Kesi. She was a daughter
  of a very rich man. Once she saw a thief who was being led to be executed. She felt
  in love with him and threatened to die uless she could marry him. Her parents therefore
  bribed the executioner and they married their daughter to the thief. But he was
  interested only in Kundala Kesi''s wealth and did not love her. One day he told
  her to put one her best clothes and jewelry and took her to the top of the mountain
  saying he wanted to pay respects to the guardian spirits for saving his life. But
  when they reached the place, the thief wanted to kill her, take her jewels and run
  away. Kundala Kesi begged him to take her things but to spare her life. Her husband
  had no mercy and still wanted to kill her. Therefore she realized that in order
  to save herself, she must kill him. She pretended she wanted to pay him her respects
  for the last time and when she was behind him, she pushed him off the mountain.
  The guardian spirit of the mountain applauded her, saying that from this one can
  clearly see that wisdom is not found only amongst men, that women are also very
  wise. Kundala Kesi then did not return home, but became a disciple of some ascetics.
  She quickly mastered their teachings and they sent her to find some better teachers.
  She wandered around and challenged everyone to dispute with her. Many did - but
  she defeated them all, since no one could answer her questions. Once she arrived
  in Savatthi. She made a small hill of sand and put a branch on top of it, thus inviting
  everybody for a dispute. Venerable Sariputta took up this challenge. Kundala Kesi
  asked him many questions, but Sariputta answered all of them without hesitation.
  Then it was his turn to ask questions. He asked just one question, "What is the
  meaning of One?" She was not able to answer, therefore she asked Sariputta to teach
  her. Sariputta told her the answer: "All the beings in the world are sustained by
  one thing - food." Kundala Kesi became a nun and within a very short time she became
  an Arahant. Some monks wondered how it was possible to attain the Awakenment after
  hearing just few words of the Dharma? The Buddha told them by this verse that one
  verse of the Dharma is better the hundreds of meaningless sentences.'
103: The story for this verse is the same as for the previous one. The highest battle
  does not take place on the battlefield, or in the political or academic arena, but
  only in our own minds. The victor of the highest battle is not somebody who conquers
  millions of enemies, who wins over his opponents, but a person who conquers the
  most difficult thing - his own mind. In other words, only an Arahant can be truly
  called a victor, because he won the final battle and he does not have to "fight"
  any more.
104: 'A certain Brahmin once approached the Buddha and told him, "Venerable Sir, although
  you know all the beneficial practices, still I think you do not know the unbeneficial
  practices." The Buddha told him that he knew both beneficial and unbeneficial practices.
  He then proceeded to enumerate six unbeneficial practices that will cause loss of
  wealth. They are: sleeping until sunrise, idleness and laziness, cruelty, indulgence
  in intoxicating drinks that cause negligence and unclear mind, wandering alone in
  the city during night hours and sexual misconduct. Then the Buddha asked the Brahmin
  how he made his living. The Brahmin told him that he earned his living by gambling,
  by playing dice. The Buddha further asked if he won or lost. The Brahmin replied
  that sometimes he won and sometimes he lost. The Buddha told him that to win in
  a game of dice couldn''t be compared with winning over one''s own mind, over one''s
  ignorance and mental defilements.'
105: The story for this verse is identical to the one for the previous verse (see
  DhP 104). The final victory in the highest battle with the mind is the attainment
  of Arahantship. When we achieve this victory, nothing in the world can "undo" it.
  Nobody can defeat us any more. No gods, not even Mara, the Evil One can do anything.
  We reach the deliverance and are free from the cycle of rebirth, from suffering
  and pain.
106: Venerable Sariputta once asked his uncle if he was doing any good deeds. His
  uncle (who was a Brahmin) replied that every month he was making offerings to ascetics,
  hoping to be reborn in the heavenly world in the future existence. Sariputta assured
  him that the ascetics did not really know the way to the heavenly world. He then
  took him to the Buddha who explained the Dharma to him and added that to pay respects
  to an Arahant is far better than to make offerings to somebody who is not really
  worth it.
107: Venerable Sariputta once asked his cousin if he was following any beneficial
  religious practices. His cousin told him that he sacrifices one goat every month
  in the fire and thus he will reach a heavenly world in his next existence. Sariputta
  explained to him, that this was not the way to the heavenly world and took him to
  see the Buddha. The Buddha taught him the Dharma and further explained to him that
  to pay respects to an Arahant is far better than to sacrifice to the fire for hundred
  years.
108: Venerable Sariputta once asked his friend, if he was following any beneficial
  religious practices. His friend, a Brahmin, told him that he was giving many sacrificial
  offerings and as a result of this he hopes to reach a heavenly world in his future
  existence. Sariputta explained to him that in this way he would certainly not reach
  any heavenly world. He then took his friend to the Buddha who taught him the Dharma
  and told him that giving sacrificial offerings every day does not count one fourth
  of showing respect to the Arahants.
109: Once there were two ascetics living together and practicing austerities. Later
  one of them returned to the lay life and got married. When a son was born to him
  and his wife, they took the boy to see the other ascetic. He said, "May you live
  long!" to the parents, but he said nothing to the child. The parents were surprised
  and asked him why did he do that. The ascetic said that he could see with his powers
  that the boy would die after seven more days. He sent them to see the Buddha, who
  could know how to prevent his death. When they got to the presence of the Buddha,
  he again said, "May you live long!" only to the parents and nothing to their son.
  In order to prevent his death, he told his parents to build a pavilion at their
  house and put the child on a couch inside it. He then sent some monks over to chant
  texts for protection. Many gods and other celestial beings came to the pavilion
  and were in attendance. On the seventh day, the Buddha himself arrived. Then an
  evil demon came to the pavilion and stood by the entrance. He waited for an opportunity
  to attack the boy. But as there were so many powerful beings around, he could not
  get near him. The chanting continued through the whole night, and in the morning
  the demon had to leave. The young child was saved. He then paid his respects to
  the Buddha who then told him, "May you live long!" The Buddha then told the parents
  that their child would live a very long life. Many years passed and the boy grew
  up. Once he came to see the Buddha and asked him how to gain longevity. The Buddha
  replied with this verse, saying that those who respect people of virtuous character
  and who pay homage to those worth paying homage, not only will gain longevity, but
  also beauty, happiness and strength.
110: A group of monks took a subject of meditation from the Buddha and went to a forest
  village to practice. There were robbers in the jungle around the village. They wanted
  to make a human sacrifice and they decided to offer one of the monks to the spirits
  of the forest. They went to the monastery and told the monks to select one of them
  who would follow them to the jungle and be sacrificed. All of the monks volunteered.
  There was a young novice with them, named Samkicca. Although he was very young,
  he was already an Arahant. He told the monks that Venerable Sariputta sent him to
  that place with the task to be the one to go with the robbers. Although the other
  monks did not like it a lot, still they trusted in Sariputta's judgment and so let
  Samkicca go. The bloody sacrifice was prepared deep in the jungle and the leader
  of the robbers took a sword and wanted to cut the young novice's head. At that time,
  Samkicca was in deep meditation and the sword did not cut him, but just curled up.
  The robber took another sword and hit again - only to find that the sword has bent
  upward. Samkicca was still unharmed. The robbers were terrified; all of them knelt
  down at the novice's feet and asked for forgiveness. They also asked his permission
  to become monks. He complied with this request and returned to the monastery with
  the new monks. Everybody was very happy that Samkicca was unharmed and that he managed
  to bring the robbers into the Sangha. They all left for Savatthi to pay homage to
  the Buddha and Venerable Sariputta. The Buddha then admonished them with this verse,
  saying that it is better to live just for one day, but virtuously and in meditation,
  than to live a very long life, but immorally and without any self-control.
111: Venerable Kondabba once took a subject of meditation from the Buddha and went
  to practice to the forest. Soon he attained Awakenment. He was on his way back to
  the monastery and had to spend the night on the way. He sat by the road on a piece
  of rock and rested, in the deep meditation. That night some robbers stole many thing
  in a village and came to the same place where Kondabba was sitting. They mistook
  him for a tree and put their loot all over and around his body. Then they fell asleep.
  In the morning they realized that he was a living being and became frightened, because
  they though he was a ghost. Kondabba told them that he was only a monk. The robbers
  were very impressed by him. They paid homage to him and asked him to allow them
  to become monks themselves. Kondabba ordained them and together they returned to
  the monastery to see the Buddha. The Buddha spoke to them this verse, saying that
  it was better to live just one single day, meditating and cultivating wisdom, than
  a hundred years without any self-control and totally devoid of any wisdom.
112: There was a certain monk named Sappadasa, who was not happy with his life in
  the monastery. Although he tried his best, he could not attain Awakenment therefore
  he felt he was unable to do it and wanted to return to the worldly life. But he
  thought that would be very humiliating for him to do so. He contemplated his options
  and at the end he decided to commit suicide. He tried to put his hand into a pot
  with snakes but the snakes would not bite him. So he took a razor and wanted to
  cut his throat. He put the razor on his throat, but as he was about to cut himself,
  he reflected on his life as a monk. He realized that he had led a pure life, full
  of morality and spirituality. He became full of satisfaction and happiness. Then
  he detached himself from these feelings and reached Awakenment instantly. The other
  monks asked him what happened to him and he told them his story. They went to ask
  the Buddha if it was possible for someone to attain Arahantship while attempting
  suicide. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that indeed it was possible.
  He added that in reaching the Awakenment, time and space is not really relevant.
  It is possible to reach it while walking, before one's foot touches the ground.
113: In Savatthi there lived a wealthy man. He had a daughter named Patacara. She
  was very beautiful and was guarded by her parents when she grew up. But she fell
  in love with her young servant and ran away with him. They settled in a small village
  far away from her former home. When she became pregnant, she wanted to go back to
  her parents' house to deliver the baby there. Her husband was afraid that they would
  punish him, so he refused to go. But Patacara really wanted to go, so she set out
  for home while he was away. Her husband hurried after her and caught her on the
  way. She delivered the baby right there and returned home with him. After some time,
  she became pregnant again. Again she requested they return back to Savatthi, again
  her husband refused. As before, she ran away, taking her first born with her. Her
  husband again found her and wanted to take her back home. At that time, she was
  about to deliver the baby. So he went away to search for a good place. While he
  was clearing some piece of land, a snake bit him and he died. Patacara delivered
  the baby and in the morning she searched for her husband only to find him dead.
  She was very upset and blamed herself for his death. With both her children she
  continued to Savatthi. She came to a river, which was full and flooded, because
  it was raining. She was unable to carry both of her children at the same time. So
  she left the older boy at the bank and crossed the river with her newborn. She left
  him on the other side and went back to get her older child. While she was in the
  middle, a hawk attacked her newborn baby. She tried to frighten him away and shouted,
  but it carried the baby with it. The elder child heard his mother shouting and thought
  she was calling for him. So he tried to cross the river, only to be carried away
  by the strong current. Grief-stricken and crying she continued to Savatthi. At the
  outskirts of the city she asked a passer-by about her family. The man told her,
  that there was a terrible storm last night, her parents' house had fallen down,
  and both her parents and her brother died. So Patacara lost all her family. On hearing
  this last piece of news she went completely crazy. Her clothes had fallen of her,
  but she did not notice and roamed through the streets of Savatthi. After a time
  she reached the Jetavana monastery, where the Buddha was staying at that time. People
  did not want to allow her to enter, but the Buddha told them to let her come in.
  When Patacara got to the Buddha, he told her to calm down and exercise some self-control.
  She then realized she was naked and covered herself with a piece of cloth. She told
  the Buddha her story. The Buddha then preached the Dharma to her, telling her that
  the number of lives when she lost her relatives and cried, was innumerable. At the
  end of the discourse Patacara reached a first degree of Awakenment. She became a
  nun. Once she was washing her feet in the evening. She poured water from the pot,
  it flowed a short distance and disappeared in the ground. She poured the second
  time and water flowed little bit farther. When she poured water for the third time,
  it flowed farthest. She stood there contemplating that all things rise and fall,
  are born and die, some for a short time, some for longer. The Buddha saw her thoughts
  and told her this verse, saying that it was better to live shortly and understand
  this law than to live for hundred years and not to see it. Patacara understood and
  attained Awakenment.
114: 'In Savatthi there lived a young woman Kisa Gotami. She married a wealthy young
  man, became pregnant and delivered a baby. But the baby died shortly after he was
  born. Kisa Gotami was grieving so much that she went all around the city, carrying
  her dead baby, and asking if somebody knew a cure that would bring him back to life.
  One of those people sent her to the Buddha, thinking that maybe he could help her
  in some way. The Buddha told her that indeed he knew a cure. He requested one mustard
  seed from a house where nobody has died. Kisa Gotami thought it to be an easy task.
  Full of joy she began running from house to house asking if somebody died there.
  But she soon found out that there was death in every household in Savatthi and she
  was not the only one who lost somebody. She realized that everybody has to die and
  was no longer attached to her dead baby. Kisa Gotami buried her son and went back
  to the monastery, where she requested to be permitted to become a nun. The Buddha
  sent her to the community of the nuns and she was ordained. She was very diligent,
  always meditating and purifying her mind. One evening she was lightning oil lamps.
  She lighted them and kept looking at the flames. She soon realized that some flames
  were burning constantly, but other flickered out. She contemplated that it is exactly
  same with living beings: some flare up but others flicker out - only the Arahants
  can be seen no more. The Buddha saw her thoughts and told her this verse, saying
  that it is better to live just for one day and see the deathless state (Nirvana)
  than to live for hundred years without seeing it. After hearing the verse, Kisa
  Gotami attained Awakenment.'
115: In Savatthi there lived a husband and wife. They had many children and when they
  grew up, they got married and lived a nice life. The husband then died and the wife,
  Bahu Puttika, kept all the property to herself. The children asked her many timed
  to give them their inheritance and promised to look after her well. So at the end
  she agreed and divided up everything to her children and left nothing for herself.
  She went to stay with her eldest son. But after few days his wife started complaining
  that she did not give them two shares so how she dares to come to stay with them.
  Bahu Puttika went to the second son, where the same happened. So she went from one
  child to another but she was not welcome anywhere. She realized that nobody would
  give her proper care, so she decided to become a nun. Now because she left the home
  very old, she knew she did not have much time. Therefore she was extremely diligent
  and practiced meditation with a strong energy. The Buddha saw her effort and praised
  her with this verse, saying that it was better to live just for a short time but
  be able to realize the Dharma. A life, which lasts for many years, but is without
  understanding the Law, is useless. After hearing the verse, Bahu Puttika attained
  Awakenment.
116: In Savatthi there lived a poor brahmin with his wife. They had only one piece
  of outer garment, so only one of them could go out at one time. They were lay disciple
  of the Buddha and wanted to hear as many of his discourses as possible. So the brahmin
  would go to the monastery at night and his wife during the day. Once the brahmin
  was listening to the Buddha and he felt very strong wish to perform meritorious
  deeds. He wanted to offer his only piece of cloth to the Buddha. But he realized
  that he and his wife would have nothing to wear then. So his mind wavered and he
  hesitated. Finally during the last hours of the night he offered his cloth to the
  Buddha, saying, "I win!" The king of Kosala, Pasenadi, was also present, and when
  he heard the brahmin he sent messengers to ask why he shouted, "I win!" When he
  learned the brahmin's story, he was very much impressed and decided to give him
  a reward. He ordered the brahmin be offered a new piece of cloth. The brahmin gave
  that piece also to the Buddha. The king gave him two pieces of cloth, which were
  again offered to the Buddha. Pasenadi again doubled the number of clothes; the brahmin
  again gave them to the Buddha. So at the end the king gave him thirty-two pieces
  of cloth, the brahmin kept one for himself, one for his wife, and remaining thirty
  he again offered to the Buddha. The king was so much impressed that he decided to
  reward the brahmin further. He gave him two pieces of very expensive velvet cloth.
  The brahmin made two canopies out of them, kept one for himself and his wife and
  the second one he offered to the Buddha. The king then saw the canopy in the monastery
  and realized that the brahmin has done a meritorious deed again. So he decided to
  reward him even more. Some monks wondered how it was possible that in this case
  a good deed brings good results so quickly. The Buddha replied, that had the brahmin
  offered his garment immediately when the idea occurred to him, his reward would
  have been much greater. He then added this verse, saying that if one wants to perform
  meritorious deeds, one should do so quickly, without hesitation. If one thinks about
  it too long, then maybe it becomes impossible to do anything at all, because the
  mind delights in evil.
117: There was a monk named Seyyasaka. He was not satisfied with his life as a monk.
  He had a habit of masturbating. When the Buddha heard about this, he admonished
  the monk for giving in to his desire for sensual pleasures. He made a new rule for
  the community of monks and nuns to abstain from such acts. He then added this verse,
  saying that one should not perform evil again and again, because such behavior leads
  to much suffering.
118: Venerable Mahakassapa once stayed in a cave, practicing meditation for seven
  days. When he arose from his meditation he wanted to give somebody a chance to gain
  merit by offering him food. He saw a young girl cooking meal. So he stood by her
  door looking for almsfood. She saw him and happily offered him some food, wishing
  that the merit gained offering might help her to realize the truth. After some time
  she was bitten by a snake and died. She was reborn as a goddess in Tavatimsa heaven.
  She understood that she was reborn there only because of the merit gained by offering
  almsfood to Kassapa. She wished to continue doing good deeds. So every morning she
  would come to the monastery, sweep the floor and fill the water-pots. At first Kassapa
  thought that some diligent young novice was doing this service, but later he found
  out that a goddess performed them all. He advised her not to come to the monastery
  too often, because people might start talking, if they saw her often there. She
  was quite upset and begged him not to destroy her chances for gaining more merit.
  The Buddha heard her and supported Kassapa's opinion. He told her that although
  performing good deeds was very pleasant, she should not continue coming to the monastery
  every day.
119: One of the most famous benefactors of the Buddha was Anathapindika from the city
  of Savatthi. He built the Jetavana monastery and regularly donated food and other
  requisites to the community of the Buddha's followers. By doing so, he gave away
  most of his wealth and became poor. The guardian spirit of his house came to him
  and told him to stop donating for some time, make money, become rich again, and
  then continue giving. Anathapindika told the spirit to leave his house for saying
  such things. The guardian spirit went to see Sakka, the king of the gods, and asked
  him what should he do to get pardon from Anathapindika. Sakka told him that there
  was some money Anathapindika loaned to others and did not collect it back yet. He
  also pointed to the guardian spirit some wealth buried by Anathapindika's ancestors.
  The spirit collected all those riches and brought them to Anathapindika’s house.
  Anathapindika then permitted the spirit to enter the house and continue living there.
  The Buddha learned about this story and told them these two verses (DhP 119 and
  120). Even though the good person can come to misfortune sometimes, the results
  of his good deeds will come sure enough - and so will the results of evil deeds
  of a bad person, even though for some time he might enjoy luck and happiness.
120: The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous verse.
  Sometimes it seems that people, who are committing evil deeds are lucky and enjoy
  happy life, whereas those, who are good and perform only meritorious deeds suffer
  the most. But at the end, the results of the deeds will ripe and when the time comes
  to that, the evildoer will finally receive the fruit of his evil deeds and the good
  person will be able to see the results of his beneficial actions.
121: A certain monk would use a piece of furniture for some time and then leave it
  outside in the monastery yard, exposing it to sun and rain. Other monks tried to
  admonish him, but he always said only that it is not his intention to destroy the
  things, and that no serious harm was actually done. When the Buddha found out about
  this, he sent for the monk and told him this verse, saying that one should not disregard
  evil, however small, because a hundred small evils is actually equal to one big
  evil. Moreover, if one gets used to small evils, a bad habit is established, and
  a great evil then does not seem so terrible to such a person.
122: A certain man from the city of Savatthi wanted to give in charity. Especially
  he wanted to get others to do so. He invited the Buddha with monks for meal the
  next day. He went around his neighbors and asked them to contribute if they want
  to participate in the almsgiving. One rich man thought that this man does not have
  enough money to do it himself and he was unhappy about this. So he contributed only
  a little amount of food. His contribution was kept separately and was not put together
  with the food that others contributed. The rich man thought that the man wanted
  others to know, that he, the rich man, has given only such a little amount. So the
  next day he sent a servant over to the house, where the alms were being given, and
  told him to observe everything. The servant told the rich man, that his food was
  distributed in very small amounts into everything. This was done, so that the rich
  man would gain a lot of merit. But he did not understand it and the next day he
  went to the man's house, intending to kill him if he dared to reveal that he offered
  so little. But the man told him the true reason of his action. The rich man realized
  his evil thoughts and apologized to the man. The Buddha heard this and told the
  rich man this verse, saying that we should not disregard good deeds, even if they
  seem small. Someday, doing of good deeds will become a habit, and thus we can perform
  a big good deed.
123: In Savatthi there lived a rich merchant named Maha Dhana. A group of robbers
  wanted to rob him. Maha Dhana decided to make a journey with a lot of valuable merchandise.
  He invited some monks who wanted to go on the same journey to go with him. The robbers
  hid themselves in a forest and waited for Maha Dhana's caravan. But Maha Dhana found
  out about their plan and decided to stop just in front of the forest and wait for
  the robbers to leave. When they did not do so, Maha Dhana decided to go back home.
  The robbers found out and planned to attack him on the return journey. Some people
  told Maha Dhana about this and so he stopped in the village and stayed there for
  some time. The monks returned back to Savatthi and told the Buddha what happened.
  Buddha told them this verse, saying, that a merchant is wise to keep away from the
  journey full of robbers. Also one who wants to live better keep away from poison.
  And those, who want to attain Awakenment, should avoid evil.
124: A daughter of a rich family once lived in Rajagaha. She was very wise and understood
  the Dharma - she had attained the first stage of Awakenment. Once she met a hunter
  named Kukkuta Mitta and they fell in love. They got married and had seven children.
  After many years, all the children got themselves married. Once the Buddha walked
  past one of Kukkuta Mitta's traps and he sat under a tree not far away and rested.
  Kukkuta Mitta came, saw the footsteps, but he saw no animal. So he thought that
  somebody stole his animal from the trap. Seeing the Buddha close, he took him to
  be that person. He became very angry and wanted to kill the Buddha. He took his
  bow and arrow, but as he was about to shoot he became immobilized just like a statue.
  His children came next and saw what happened to their father. They too took bows
  and arrows and tried to shoot the Buddha, only to become "statues" themselves. When
  they did not return in time, the hunter's wife went to the forest to look for them.
  When she saw what happened, she shouted to them, "Don't kill my father!" The hunter
  and his children thought that the Buddha was her real father and they ceased hating
  him. Immediately they were able to move again. The woman told them to put down their
  bows and arrows and when they did so, the Buddha expounded the Dharma. At the end
  of the discourse, all of them also attained the first stage of Awakenment. The Buddha
  went back to the monastery and told the monks the story. Some monks wondered how
  the woman, having already reached the first stage of Awakenment, could help her
  husband to take lives of animals. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that
  if one has no intention to commit evil, no bad karma is actually created.
125: A hunter named Koka was leaving the city to hunt with his dogs. He met a monk
  who was entering the city to obtain some almsfood. The hunter took this for a bad
  sign and thought that that day he wouldn’t catch any animal. And that also happened
  - he did not get anything. Angry he went back home. On entering the city he met
  the same monk who obtained his food and was returning to the monastery. The hunter
  became so angry that he sent his dogs to kill the monk. But he climbed a tree and
  the dogs were unable to reach him. The hunter took an arrow and pricked the monk's
  feet with it. The monk was in pain and his robe fell down. It just happened that
  the hunter was standing directly bellow. The robe fell onto him. His dogs thought
  that the monk fell down and attacked him. The monk threw some branches down and
  only then the dogs realized that they attacked their own master and ran away. The
  monk climbed down and found out that the hunter was already dead. When he returned
  to the monastery, he went to see the Buddha, because he felt responsible for the
  hunter's death. But the Buddha told him that he was not responsible at all. Only
  hunter himself and his foolish actions caused him the untimely death. The Buddha
  then added this verse, saying that whoever wants to harm an innocent, calls evil
  on himself. Just like trying to throw dust against the wind - it will just come
  back and fall upon the very person who threw it.
126: In the city of Sāvatthi once lived a gem polisher. He has been giving almsfood
  to a certain monk for the last twelve years. One day, the gem polisher was carrying
  a piece of meat when a messenger for the king arrived, giving him a piece of gem
  that the king wanted to be cut and polished. The gem polisher took the gem with
  his hands bloody from the meat, put it on the table and went to wash his hands.
  The family had a pet bird. When it saw the gem covered with blood, it took it for
  a piece of meat and ate it. When the gem polisher returned, he did not see the gem
  anywhere. He asked everybody, but nobody knew anything. At the end he also asked
  the monk, who was also present. The monk replied that he did not take the gem. The
  gem polisher was convinced, that the monk was lying and decided to inflict torture
  on him. Even though his wife discouraged him from this action, saying that this
  monk was an Arahant and their teacher for so many years, the gem polisher paid no
  attention. He tied the monk up and beat him with a stick. The monk started to bleed
  all over his body and the bird came over again, drawn by the blood. The gem polisher
  was angry and kicked the bird, killing it instantly. Only then did the monk reveal
  that the bird ate the gem. The gem polisher cut the bird open and indeed found the
  gem inside. Immediately he untied the monk and asked for forgiveness. The monk replied
  that he feels no hatred towards him and even agreed to continue coming to his house
  for almsfood. Only after this he would not enter the house - just stay by the door.
  Soon after, the monk died from his injuries and reached the final Nirvana. The bird
  was born as the gem polisher's son. When the gem polisher died he was born in hell
  and his wife in heaven, because she spoke against beating of the innocent monk.
127: Three groups of monks were traveling from far away to see the Buddha. On the
  way strange things happened to them. The first group stayed in a village on their
  way. Some people were cooking meal when their hut caught fire and burned. A crow
  was flying over the place, got caught in the fire and died. When they met the Buddha,
  he told them this story. One farmer had a very lazy ox. It would not work, it would
  only lie down, eat and sleep. The farmer once got so angry, that he put a rope around
  the neck of the animal and set fire to it. So the ox died. Because of this, the
  farmer was reborn as a crow and died in the fire himself. The second group took
  a boat. In the middle of the ocean the ship would not suddenly move. They searched
  for the unlucky person, who is causing this to happen. Three times lots were drawn
  and three times it fell on the captain's wife. So at the end they tied a pot of
  sand to her neck and drowned her. The ship then continued to the port safely and
  the monks got to see the Buddha. He told them, that once there was a woman who had
  a pet dog. The dog would follow her everywhere; it just would not stay away even
  for a moment. Some people were making fun of her. So she felt ashamed, tied a pot
  of sand around the dog's neck and drowned it. Because of this, she was reborn as
  that unlucky woman who was drowned by other people. The third group of seven monks
  stayed in a cave overnight. In the middle of the night a big rock fell from the
  mountain above and blocked the entrance into the cave. People discovered them in
  the morning and tried to move the rock, but they were unable to do it. Only on the
  seventh day they moved the rock away and the monks were free. To them the Buddha
  related the story of seven cowherds who chased an iguana into a mound and for fun
  closed all the entrances. They let the iguana out only after seven days. So in this
  life they were reborn as the seven monks who were trapped in the cave for a week.
  At the end the Buddha said this verse, saying that one can never escape the consequences
  of evil deeds. They will find us anywhere, nobody can hide from them, even in the
  air, ocean or in a cave - the consequences will befall us surely.
128: Buddha had also some enemies. One of them was his own cousin Devadatta who wanted
  to take the Buddha's place in the Community. Devadatta's father was king Suppabuddha.
  He was also an enemy of the Buddha, because the Buddha married Suppabuddha's daughter,
  Yasodhara, and later left her and became a monk. When the Buddha came for almsfood
  to his place, the king got drunk and blocked the way. He refused to make way for
  the Buddha. The Buddha turned around and went back, saying to the monks that the
  king make a bad karma by refusing to make way for a Buddha and would have to face
  the consequences very soon. Suppabuddha wanted to prove the Buddha wrong, so he
  paid special attention to his deeds and also instructed his servants to protect
  him very carefully. But on the seventh day he heard his horse neighing loudly and
  kicking about. He wanted to handle the horse and went down to the stable. He fell
  down the stairs and died immediately. The Buddha remarked that one can not escape
  death no matter how one tries, no matter where on hides.
129: One group of monks was cleaning a certain building in the Jetavana monastery.
  They intended to stay there. When they were in the middle of cleaning, another group
  of monks arrived there and wanted them to give the building over to them. They felt
  that as they were more senior monks, they should have the right to choose. But the
  first group did not agree to that and insisted on keeping the building to themselves.
  The monks from the second group beat them up till the monks cried in pain. When
  the Buddha heard about this, he admonished the second group of monks harshly for
  inflicting pain on their fellow monks. He told them this verse, saying that violence
  is not a solution. He moreover laid down a new rule for the monks to abstain from
  hurting others.
130: In the last verse (see DhP 129) we saw monks beating each other because of a
  building. But the question of the building arose again. The second group of monks
  still intended to take it for themselves and again, the first group did not agree
  to that. As a new rule was established, the monks from the second group did not
  physically attack the first group, but they made threatening gestures to them. The
  monks from the first group were frightened and cried out. The Buddha again admonished
  the second group of monks, telling them this verse. And he also set another rule,
  that monks should not make threatening gestures to each other.
131: The Buddha once saw a group of young men from Savatthi beating a snake with sticks.
  He asked why were they doing such thing. The youths answered that they were afraid
  of being bitten by the snake therefore they beat it. The Buddha told them this verse,
  saying that if we do not wish to be harm by some being the first step is not to
  harm it ourselves. The young men attained the first stage of Awakenment after hearing
  this discourse.
132: The story for this verse is identical with that to the previous one (DhP 131).
  To abstain from violence is one of the basic principles of the Buddha's teaching.
  Especially in the case of the young men hurting the snake it can be seen that to
  hurt somebody first to stop him from hurting me is not a good idea. We should practice
  the universal loving kindness, known as metta and try to radiate it to all the directions.
  When faced with danger, we should radiate this metta towards the being that intends
  or might intend to hurt us.
133: There was a monk named Kundadhana. From the day he became a monk, others saw
  a female form always following him everywhere. But he himself did not see anything.
  Once he went out on to gather alms food and people offered him two portions of food,
  saying that one was for him and the other for his friend. Then they reported to
  the king that one of the monks seems to have a girlfriend. The king Pasenadi started
  to investigate the matter. When the king was in the room with the monk, the female
  form was not present. The monk himself also professed his innocence. When the king
  sent him out of the room, the female form suddenly appeared close to him. The king
  realized that the woman was not real and the monk was really innocent. So he invited
  him for almsfood. The other monks were not happy and started to scold Kundadhana,
  saying that in fact he had a girlfriend somewhere and that he had no morals. Kundadhana
  got angry and retorted with his own accusations. The Buddha then admonished him
  and told him this verse. He further explained, that in his previous life Kundadhana
  was a deity who wanted to create discord between two monks who very good friends.
  He would assume the form of a woman and follow closely one of them, thus hoping
  to stop their friendship. For that deed a female form was now following him.
134: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the preceding verse (see
  DhP 133). The vibrations in this verse point mainly to passion and hatred. If we
  do not have these feelings, then we are silent, just like a broken gong. It will
  not resonate when we try to hit it. In the same way, when we are devoid of passions
  and are "hit" by the objects that are usually causing them, we will not "resonate".
  That means, we are completely without passion, hatred and ignorance - and we have
  reached the goal, attained Nirvana and stopped all the suffering.
135: A large group of women came to the Pubbarama monastery to observe the precepts
  for one day. Visakha, the woman who built that monastery, asked them for what purpose
  did they come to observe the precepts. Different women gave her different answers.
  Old women did so in order to have a good rebirth, middle aged women wanted to have
  peaceful and prosperous lives with their families, young women came in order to
  give birth to a son and unmarried girls wanted to find a good husband. Visakha took
  them to see the Buddha. He told her this verse, saying that although we are all
  constantly driven by birth, old age and death, there are still so few people who
  realize this and strive for Awakenment and release from this never-ending cycle.
  Most people still pursue only earthly goals and do not care about overcoming them.
136: Venerable Moggallana once went on an alms-round with Venerable Lakkhana. On the
  way from a certain hill he smiled as if he saw something strange. When they were
  back at the monastery, Lakkhana asked him about this incident. Moggalana said that
  he saw a ghost in the form of a snake, being burned by flames. The Buddha told them
  that he also saw that particular ghost and revealed to them his story. A long time
  ago there was a thief who repeatedly burned a house of a certain man. Not satisfied
  with that he also set fire to a monastery, donated by that man. As a result of these
  deeds, he was reborn as that ghost-snake, burned by flames. At the end the Buddha
  added this verse, saying that even though a fool does not realize evilness of his
  actions, the consequences will certainly reach him.
137: Some ascetics were planning to kill Venerable Moggallana because they thought
  that the Buddha and his teaching would be hurt by this action. So they hired a group
  of killers who surrounded the cave where Moggallana was staying. But he used his
  supernatural powers and escaped. The killers did not give up but were pursuing him
  around the clock. After three months Moggallana realized that he had to get caught
  as a consequence of one bad deed he committed in one of his previous life. Although
  he was an Arahant and did not create any new karma, he was still reaping fruit of
  his actions before he reached the Awakenment. So he let himself to be caught and
  the killers beat him up. When they thought he was dead, they left him in a forest
  and went away. But Moggallana was still alive, used his supernatural powers to revive
  himself for a short time and went to pay his respects to the Buddha. He told the
  Buddha what happened and the Buddha asked him to teach the Dharma to all the monks
  for one last time. Moggallana did so and died soon after that. The king ordered
  an investigation, caught the killers and executed them. The monks asked the Buddha
  how was it possible that Moggallana was killed like that. The Buddha told them a
  story from Moggallana previous life. Once he was a son of blind parents. At the
  beginning he was a very good son, treating them well. But after he got married,
  his wife hated his parents and induced him to kill them. Moggallana took his parents
  to the forest and beat them to death, while pretending that some robbers were actually
  killing them. For this deed he had to die himself in his very last existence at
  the end of killers, beaten up to death.
138: The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous verse (DhP
  137), the story of Moggallana's untimely death.
139: The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous verses
  (DhP 137, DhP 138), the story of Moggallana's untimely death.
140: The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous verses
  (DhP 137, DhP 138, DhP 139), the story of Moggallana's untimely death.
141: In Savatthi there lived a rich man named Bahu Bhandika. When his wife died, he
  decided to become a monk. But first he built himself a monastery, brought many servants
  and provisions of food with him. So even as a monk he lived in comfort and had plenty
  of delicious food every day. When the Buddha heard about this, he admonished the
  monk, saying that his teaching is about simple life and asked why did he bring so
  much property with him. The monks became angry and took off his robe, asking the
  Buddha if this was the way he wanted him to live from now on. The Buddha again admonished
  him, "How come you have lost your sense of shame and fear of evil? Even in your
  former existence as a hungry ghost you had this sense, where did it go?" The monk
  realized his mistake and apologized for getting angry and taking off his clothes.
  The Buddha then spoke this verse, saying that austerities and ascetic practices
  do not make a monk. Only when we discard ignorance can we be really free. At the
  end of this discourse, many monks present attained the first stage of Awakenment.
142: The king Pasenadi of Kosala once sent his minister Santati to deal with some
  rebellion in the border area. Santati suppressed it quickly and efficiently and
  the king was very pleased. He gave Santati many gifts, amongst others also a dancing
  girl to entertain him. The minister spent several days drinking and enjoying the
  young dancer. On the last day, he went to the river to take a bath. On the way he
  met the Buddha and some monks. Even though he was drunk, he still bowed in respect.
  The Buddha remarked to Venerable Ananda that Santati will reach the Awakenment the
  very same day and soon after that he will die. In the evening, the dancer again
  entertained Santati and his guests. While dancing, she died due to exhaustion. The
  minister was shocked and distressed. Immediately he went to the Buddha and begged
  for some words of solace. The Buddha told him to get rid of his cravings, not to
  let these feelings to enslave him. By getting rid of all the cravings, all the roots
  of evil will be destroyed and he will reach the Nirvana. After hearing this, Santati
  attained Awakenment. Realizing, that he was about to die, he thanked the Buddha
  for his help and told him that he was about to reach the final emancipation. Soon
  after that he passed away. Some monks were confused that Santati attained the Arahantship,
  although he was wearing beautiful dress and ornaments. They asked if he was a monk
  or a Brahmin. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that clothes and ornaments
  are not important. What counts is whether one has or has not freed oneself from
  ignorance and cravings.
143: Venerable Ananda once met a young beggar who was going around dressed in old
  rags and holding a begging plate. After meeting Ananda, the man decided to become
  a monk. His name was Pilotika. When he became a monk, he put his old clothes and
  the plate under a certain tree. Sometimes he felt not satisfied with his life as
  a monk and he went back to the tree and contemplated going back to the layman's
  life. But when he realized how miserable were his days before he became a monk,
  he felt shame and returned to the monastery. This happened many times. Other monks
  asked him where was he going all the time. He told them he went to see his teacher.
  Pilotika considered his old clothes and the plate to be his teacher, because they
  taught him futility of the lay life many times. He started to practice earnestly
  and took his old clothes as a meditation subject. Soon he was able to reach Awakenment
  and therefore he stopped going to the tree. Other monks asked him again, why does
  not he go to see his teacher any more. Pilotika replied that he does not have need
  for a teacher any more, hinting that he was an Arahant. The monks went to see the
  Buddha and asked him if it was true, if Pilotika has really reached the goal. The
  Buddha replied in affirmative, saying that indeed Pilotika now has no need to see
  his "teacher" because he has nothing to learn from the old clothes anymore. He has
  realized the truth and became an Arahant. The Buddha further added this verse and
  the following one (DhP 144).
144: The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous one (DhP
  143). There is no reason to whip a good horse - it knows what to do and how to do
  it. In the same way there is no need to blame a good person, he is not acting in
  a way that has to be blamed. The good horse needs only to be touched by the whip
  and then it knows what to do. So it is with a good person. He is "touched" by the
  suffering and immediately starts to make effort to escape it forever.
145: Venerable Sāriputta once had a very young novice. His name was Sukha. One day,
  he went with Sāriputta on his alms-round. He observed irrigators irrigating the
  fields, arrow-makers making their arrows and carpenters working with wood. He asked
  Venerable Sāriputta if those things, which have no mind, could be guided to wherever
  one wishes. Sāriputta replied that it is so. The young novice then thought, "If
  those things, which have no mind, could be guided to wherever one wishes, then why
  could not I master myself?" He then asked permission from Sāriputta, returned to
  the monastery and diligently practiced. He was about to attain Arahantship, when
  Sāriputta returned and was going towards the novice's hut. The Buddha saw this and
  he also saw that the novice was just about to attain the goal, so he met Sāriputta
  outside and prevented him from going to the novice's hut by asking him various questions.
  The novice indeed attained Arahantship very soon and the Buddha explained that the
  reason, why he kept Sāriputta outside, was to enable the young novice to attain
  his goal without being interrupted.
146: 'Visakha was one of the most famous female lay disciples. She was very devoted
  and generous. Once, some men from Savatthi asked Visakha to be a companion to their
  wives, who were frivolous and liked to drink alcohol. Their husband hoped that Visakha
  could have positive influence on them. Once, the group of women went to the garden.
  The wives secretly brought some liquor and got drunk. When Visakha found out about
  it, she was angry and reprimanded them. At another occasion, the women wanted to
  go to the garden again. Visakha refused, remembering what happened the last time.
  So they requested to go to the Jetavana monastery to pay respect to the Buddha.
  After arriving at the monastery, the ladies again got drunk from the liquor they
  brought secretly along. Mara further influenced their minds and the women started
  to behave shamelessly: they were dancing, singing and jumping about. When the Buddha
  saw this, he used his supernormal powers. He let the room get dark and illuminated
  the sky with rays of strong light. The women were frightened and awed at the same
  time. They got sober quickly. The Buddha admonished them for their behavior and
  for getting drunk. He told them that drinking alcohol brings pain and unhappiness,
  it clouds our minds and then we are more likely to get under influence of evil passions.
  At the end of the discourse, all the ladies were firmly established in the path
  and returned home mindfully and peacefully.'
147: In Rajagaha there lived a beautiful courtesan named Sirima. She was a devoted
  disciple of the Buddha and used to offer almsfood to the monks every day. One monk
  mentioned to his friends how generous and beautiful she was, how delicious the food
  offered by her was. One young monk heard this and fell in love with Sirima without
  even seeing her. The next day he joined the monks who went to her house. Although
  Sirima was sick, she still paid her respects to the monks and gave them almsfood.
  After seeing her, the young monk desired her even more. But that night Sirima died.
  The Buddha wanted to teach the young monk a lesson, so asked the king to keep the
  corpse for few days without burying it. On the fourth day the dead body was put
  to the cemetery ground. It was no longer beautiful, it was bloated, stinky and full
  of worms. The Buddha told the young monk if he wanted to go to see Sirima. The monk
  has not heard about her death so he was very happy to agree. How terrible his shock
  was when they got to the cemetery and he saw Sirima’s corpse! The Buddha then asked
  the king to announce, that anybody who paid one thousand coins, could spend the
  night with Sirima. But nobody wanted to do so. The price went gradually down, until
  she was available for free. But even then there was nobody willing to spend the
  night with the corpse. The Buddha then told the monks to realize, that few days
  ago many men would willing to pay even more than one thousand for a night with the
  courtesan, but now nobody wants her even for free. He further spoke on the subject
  of non-attachment to the body. The young monk gained insight into the true nature
  of the body and his love for Sirima disappeared.
148: Uttara was a very old nun - she was one hundred and twenty years old. But se
  was very generous and respectful. Many times she shared her almsfood with monks,
  just out of her kindness. Once, while going on her almsround, she met the Buddha.
  Reverentially, she stepped out of his way and paid her homage. While she was doing
  that, she accidentally stepped on her own robe and fell down. The Buddha consoled
  her and told her to understand the condition of her body. She was very old and her
  body frail and sick - she should practice diligently to perfect her mind. Uttara
  reflected on the Buddha's words and attained the first stage of Awakenment.
149: A group of monks once went to the forest to practice meditation. They were very
  diligent and very soon they attained very deep mental absorption (jhana). They mistook
  this attainment for the Arahantship. Happily they returned to the Buddha and intended
  to tell him about their achievements. When they were about to approach, the Buddha
  asked Venerable Ananda to send them to the cemetery first. Buddha knew about their
  mistaking jhana for Awakenment and had an idea how to make them realize this mistake.
  The monks went to the cemetery and saw different corpses there. When they saw old
  decaying bodies and bones, they were able to perceive them with equanimity. But
  when they saw some fresh corpses, they realized they still had some sensual desires
  left in them! The Buddha exhorted them with this verse. The monks finally understood
  how little had they achieved so far.
150: Rupananda was the Buddha's stepsister and the fiancee of his cousin. She was
  very beautiful, so she was also known as Janapada Kalyani ("Beauty of the area").
  Because all of her relatives became monks and nuns, she decided to go to the monastery
  herself. But she did so only because of attachment to her family; she was not really
  devoted to the idea. As she knew that the Buddha often talked about impermanency
  and non-attachment to the body, she did not dare to go to see him. She thought he
  would scold her for her beauty. But one day she finally decided to go and listen
  to one of the Buddha's discourses. The Buddha knew that Rupananda is very attached
  to her body and conscious of her beauty. So he created a vision of a female form
  (visible only to Rupananda) to sit near him on the stage, where he was delivering
  his speech and to fan him. The girl was very young and extremely beautiful. Rupananda
  saw her and realized that compared to this girl she herself looked like a monkey.
  While she was looking, the girl began to grow older. She became a young woman, then
  a grown up woman, middle aged, old - and finally she became a very old woman. Rupananda
  realized that the change of the body is a continuing process and she found out that
  this beautiful young girl changed into an old ugly woman. Then the woman on stage,
  no longer able to control her body, was lying there, dying and finally she died.
  Her body got swollen and worms were all over it. Rupananda thus finally realized
  that also her beauty is very impermanent - it is a subject to illness, old age and
  death. The Buddha further instructed her with this verse and at the end Rupananda
  attained Arahantship.
151: Queen Mallika was the wife of King Pasenadi. Once she went to the bathroom to
  wash herself and her dog entered with her. While she bent over to wash her feet,
  the dog started to misbehave with her and the queen did not stop it. When she came
  out, the king told her he saw everything through the window and scolded her for
  her behavior. But Mallika denied doing anything and suggested that the bathroom
  was enchanted - whoever went inside could be seen doing strange things through the
  window. She sent the king inside and when he came out, she told him she saw him
  misbehaving with a goat. The king, not being very smart accepted this as an explanation.
  But the queen felt very bad about lying to the king for many years. When she was
  dying, this moment kept coming to her consciousness over and over again. Because
  our dying thoughts determine our next birth, she was born in a state of suffering.
  The king wanted to ask the Buddha where Mallika was reborn, but Buddha was not willing
  to tell him, because he did not want to hurt Pasenadi's feelings. Only after seven
  days in the state of suffering, the queen was reborn in Tusita heaven as a result
  of her great meritorious deeds. Only then did the Buddha reply to the king's question.
  The king was happy to hear that, but at the same time he felt sad for her death.
  The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that everything is subject to old age
  and death; therefore we must practice the Dhamma diligently.
152: 'There was a monk named Laludayi. He was not very bright. He was never able to
  say things, which were appropriate for the occasion. On happy occasions he would
  talk about suffering and sorrow and on sorrowful occasions he would talk about happiness
  and joy. He was also never able to understand that he did and said something inappropriate
  in these cases. The Buddha spoke this verse in reference to Laludayi. He also revealed
  the following story: in one of his former lives, Laludayi had been a farmer. He
  had two oxen to plow the fields. Suddenly one of them died. The farmer asked his
  son to go to the king and request another ox. But the son told him to go himself
  and taught him a verse to say in front of the king. But the farmer made a mistake
  and instead of "My ox died, please give me another one", he said "My ox died, please
  take the other one away from me". Fortunately, the king was very wise and understood
  that Laludayi just made a mistake and gave him sixteen oxen to help him with his
  farming.'
153: This verse and the following one (DhP 154) are the first utterances of Prince
  Siddhattha Gotama, after he reached the supreme Awakenment, seating under the Tree
  of Awakenment. From that time on he was known as the Buddha. He finally comprehended
  what was the reason for suffering in the round of repeated rebirths - the craving
  that causes us to run in it over and over again. He formulated his teaching, summarized
  in the Four Noble Truths and became the founder of what is today known as Buddhism.
154: The story for this verse is identical with the story for the preceding one (DhP
  153). It forms a part of the first utterance of the new Buddha (The Awakened One)
  just after he reached the Awakenment. He addressed the "builder" of his personality,
  the cravings. He finally understood that the craving is the main factor in the repeated
  rebirth. He destroyed "the ribs" or body of the craving and also "the roof of the
  house" or the reason for the round of repeated existence. His mind became dissolute,
  or in other words, he has reached the Nirvana. He has attained the end of all cravings
  and thus the end of the round of rebirth.
155: There was a rich man, named Mahadhana. He had a son. The boy had not studied
  anything while young, so he remained quite ignorant. Later he married a daughter
  of another rich man, who had no education at all. When their parents died, the young
  couple inherited immense riches. But since they knew only how to spend, and not
  how to earn and look after the money, they became poor very quickly. They lost all
  of their property and had to become beggars. The Buddha saw them and commented the
  situation with this verse. He further said that had the young people study worldly
  wisdom, they would learn how to increase their riches, had they renounced the household
  life, they both could have attained Arahantship. But since they just wasted their
  youth away, they lost every opportunity - both material and spiritual.
156: The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous one (DhP
  155). If we want to accomplish something in our lives, we have to start working
  early, in the young age. Be it material or spiritual goals, we should not waste
  our time and diligently learn the necessary skills and then apply them on the road
  to the goal we want to achieve. If we do nothing in our young age, all the opportunities
  will be lost and we will grow old, without ever accomplishing anything.
157: There was a prince named Bodhiraja. He had built a new palace and invited the
  Buddha with monks for alms offering. Because the prince had no children, he spread
  some pieces of cloth on the floor and made a wish that if the Buddha stepped on
  the cloth, he and his wife would be able to have children. When the Buddha came,
  he asked Bodhiraja to remove the cloth. He told him he and his wife could not have
  children because of evil deeds they committed in the past. The Buddha then related
  the story to the prince. He and his wife had been the only survivors of a shipwreck
  in one of their past existences. They were stranded on an island and ate the birds.
  They also ate their eggs and small fledglings. They did not even feel a slightest
  remorse for killing some other living creatures' babies. Because of that, they would
  not able to have any children in this life.
158: There was a monk named Upananda. He was a very good orator. He would preach eloquently
  about being satisfied with little, about contentment and about austerity, but actually
  he was very greedy and always took all he could get. Once he wanted to spend the
  Rain Retreat in one monastery. When he found out that at the end of the retreat
  the monks there received only one robe each, he decided to go away. But he left
  his slippers there. It was similar at the second monastery, where the monks usually
  got two robes - he did not stay but left his staff. At the third monastery he left
  his water bottle, but himself left, because three robes that monks received there,
  did not satisfy him. Finally, he spent the Rain Retreat in the fourth monastery,
  where he received four robes at the end of the retreat. Because he left his things
  in three previous temples, he also claimed his share of the robes from them! So,
  he set on the way back to his own monastery with ten robes. On the way he met two
  monks, who could not agree how to divide two robes and a blanket between themselves.
  Upananda agreed to act as an arbiter. He gave each of them one robe and he himself
  kept the blanket as a payment for his arbitration. The monks went to see the Buddha
  and reported to him what happened. The Buddha reprimanded Upananda with this verse,
  saying that before one can teach others, he has to act properly - especially in
  the subject he wants to teach.
159: There was a monk named Padhanika Tissa. He has several monks as his students.
  He taught them how to meditate and told them to be always vigilant and diligent.
  In the evening he would tell them to keep practicing and then he would go to sleep.
  At night, just when the monks were about to go to bed, he returned and told them
  to continue meditating. The monks were very tired because of lack of sleep. But
  they were still very obedient and even admired their teacher for being so diligent.
  Once they went to investigate how he meditates - only to find their teacher asleep!
  They became dissatisfied and as a result they made very little progress in their
  meditation. When they returned to the Jetavana monastery to see the Buddha, they
  told him about their teacher. The Buddha advised them with this verse, saying that
  a teacher should first master the subject himself completely and only then attempt
  to teach others.
160: There was a young married woman who wanted to become a nun. She got permission
  from her husband and entered the Order. She became a pupil of Devadatta, the Buddha's
  cousin. Before she became a nun, she was already pregnant but did not know about
  it. When she found out, she asked Devadatta what to do. He sent her back to the
  lay life. But the woman was not happy and went to see the Buddha. The Buddha sent
  for Upali, who was the master of Vinaya, rules of conduct. He further asked the
  king Pasenadi and the famous lay devotes, Anathapindika and Visakha to come and
  settle the case. Visakha examined the young woman and told Upali that she was already
  pregnant when she joined the Order. Upali therefore declared that the woman was
  pure of any misconduct and could continue her life as a nun. Later the woman gave
  birth to a son. He was named Kumara Kassapa and king Pasenadi adopted him. At the
  age of seven, the boy became a novice and when he was eighteen, he received the
  full ordination. He went to the forest to practice meditation and soon attained
  Arahantship. He lived in the forest for twelve years and then went back to the monastery.
  His mother was very attached to him and whenever she saw him she would run after
  him calling his name. Kumara Kassapa decided that he should help his mother to get
  rid of this attachment. Therefore he spoke coolly to her, "How is it possible that
  you, as a nun, can not cut off even the affection for your son?" The woman reflected,
  "I have been weeping for twelve years, waiting for my son. Now he speaks so harshly
  to me! Why should I be attached to him?" Then she realized danger of all attachments
  and very soon reached Arahanthsip. The monks then remarked to the Buddha that if
  the woman had listened to Devadatta's words, neither she nor her son would have
  reached Arahantship. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that in striving
  for the goal one must depend only on himself and not seek others to lean on.
161: There was a lay disciple named Mahakala. Once he spent the night in the monastery,
  observing the eight precepts and meditating. In the morning, on his way home, he
  stopped by a pond to wash his face. On the same night some thieves broke into a
  house and were chased by the owners. The thieves dropped their stolen things in
  front of Mahakala and ran away. The owners mistook Mahakala for a thief and beat
  him up. Mahakala died of his injuries. Some monks discovered his body and reported
  the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha explained, that in one of his previous lives,
  Mahakala fell in love with a certain woman and had beaten her husband to death.
  He then added this verse, saying that one's own evil deeds surely come back to their
  doer and fall back on his head.
162: 'Some monks were discussing the subject of Devadatta, the Buddha''s cousin, amongst
  themselves. They summed up all his bad actions: he got the confidence of prince
  Ajatasattu by unfair means, thus trying to gain fame. He instigated the prince to
  kill his own father, king Bimbisara and to become the king himself. Devadatta even
  tried to kill the Buddha for three times. The monks reported the matter to the Buddha
  and added that Devadatta was a man without shame and morality. The Buddha then said
  that Devadatta was trying to kill him in many if the past lives. The Buddha spoke
  this verse, saying that immoral people will destroy themselves - just like a creeper
  strangles the tree on which it is spread.'
163: 'The Buddha had a cousin Devadatta. He also became a monk but he was vicked.
  He envied the Buddha and wanted to take his place as the head of the Buddhist community.
  He went to see the Buddha and suggested, that since the Buddha is getting old, he,
  Devadatta should from now on be the leader of the Buddhist Order. The Buddha refused.
  Devadatta then tried to kill the Buddha three times, but he was not successful.
  Later Devadatta had another plan. He went to see the Buddha and suggested five new
  rules for all monks to follow: 1) to live only in forests, 2) to eat only almsfood,
  3) to wear only robes they make themselves from discarded pieces of cloth found
  on rubbish heaps, 4) to sleep under trees, 5) not to eat any meat (including fish).
  The Buddha told him that, whoever wants to follow these rules, can do so. But they
  will not become binding for all the monks, because they are too strict and the Buddha''s
  teaching teaches the Middle Path. Devadatta was angry and tried to find some more
  followers. Indeed, he found some young monks who thought the rules of Devadatta
  were much better than those, introduced by the Buddha. The Buddha questioned Devadatta
  about his intentions and the later admitted ha was trying to create a schism in
  the Community. The Buddha tried to explain him that to create a schism is a very
  bad deed, but Devadatta did not care. He took his followers and departed for the
  place called Gayasisa where he established a new Order. Two prominents disciple
  of the Buddha, Sariputta and Moggallana were able to make most of the Devadatta''s
  followers realize their mistake and make them come back to the Buddha. The Buddha
  commented the situation with this verse, saying that good and beneficial deeds are
  very difficult to perform, whereas an evil deed is done very quickly and without
  any difficulty.'
164: In Savatthi there lived an old woman who was looking after a monk named Kala.
  She often expressed her wish to go to the Jetavana monastery to hear the teaching
  from the Buddha’s own mouth. Three times she told Kala about her wish and three
  times he advised her not to go. However, one day she went to the monastery in spite
  of his objections. Kala thought that she would have no more use for him, if she
  hears the Buddha to speak. So he went to the Buddha and told him not to teach the
  woman anything deep, because she was very stupid. The Buddha knew the real reason
  for Kala's words and he admonished him with this verse, saying that one who abuses
  the Teaching, is only destroying himself.
165: There was a lay disciple named Culakala. Once he spent the night in the monastery,
  observing the eight precepts and practicing meditation. In the morning he was returning
  home and met a group of thieves who were being chased by the owners of the stolen
  goods. The thieves put their loot in front of Culakala and ran away. The owners
  mistook Culakala for a thief and started to beat him. Some prostitutes, who were
  on the way to the river, saw the whole incident and told the people Culakala was
  innocent. The owners let him go. When the Buddha was told about this, he replied
  with this verse and added that Culakala was truly innocent and therefore had nothing
  to fear.
166: Close to the age of eighty, the Buddha declared that he would attain his final
  Parinirvana in four months. There were many monks who have not reached the final
  goal yet and they were very distressed. They wept and kept close to the Buddha all
  the time. There was a monk, named Attadatta who decided to honor the Buddha by attaining
  the Awakenment during his lifetime. So he kept alone and practiced diligently. Some
  other monks did not understand his intention and told Buddha, "Attadatta does not
  love you, he did not come to pay homage to you! He is egoistic, indeed!" Attadatta
  explained his behavior, saying that in his opinion the greatest homage to Buddha
  would be if he attained the Arahantship within the remaining four months of the
  Buddha's life. The Buddha approved of this and replied with this verse, saying that
  in spiritual attainment, one should diligently strive to reach the goal oneself
  and only then do other things.
167: Visakha was a very famous benefactress of the Buddhist Community from Savatthi.
  Once an older monks with his young pupil came to her house for almsfood. Visakha's
  granddaughter was filtering water for the young monk and when she saw her reflection
  on the surface of the water, she laughed. The young monk also laughed. The girl
  got angry and said, "You shaven head, why do you laugh at me?!" The monk did not
  like it and replied, "You and your family are shaven heads yourself!" The girl went
  weeping to Visakha. Visakha tried to appease both the girl and the monk but the
  monk was angry and did not accept her explanations and apologies. The older monk
  also tried his best but did not succeed either. The matter was brought to the Buddha,
  who saw that the monk was ready to reach the first stage of Awakenment. So he asked
  Visakha, "Why did your granddaughter had to address my monk as a shaven head? All
  the monks had to shave their heads when they became members of the Community!" The
  young monk felt very happy and praised the Buddha that he was the only one who could
  understand him. The Buddha then replied with this verse, saying that the monk was
  also to blame; he should not quarrel because of such a small and unimportant thing.
  Hearing that, the young monk reached the first stage of Awakenment.
168: When the Buddha attained Awakenment, one of his first big journeys took him to
  the city of Kapilavatthu, where most of his family lived. He stayed at the outskirts
  of the city, in the Nigrodharama monastery. His father, king Suddhodana, assumed,
  that his son would come to his palace for food and made a lot of almsfood prepared.
  However, he did not invite the Buddha, as was necessary. So the Buddha went on almsround
  around the city, as was his custom. He asked himself, if this was the proper course
  of action and realized that all the Buddhas of the past also went on almsround around
  the city they were born. Suddhodana heard about it and went to the Buddha, saying,
  "Why should my son ask for alms in the very city, where he used to travel in a golden
  palanquin? I am so ashamed!" The Buddha explained to him that he was only following
  the old custom of all the Buddhas and did not wish to put Suddhodana to shame. He
  also uttered this verse and the following one (DhP 169). The king finally accepted
  it and was no longer offended.
169: The story for this verse is identical with the story for the preceding one (DhP
  168).
170: A group of monks went to the forest to practice meditation. But they made very
  little progress and decided to return to the Buddha and ask for further instructions.
  On the way to the monastery it was very hot and they saw a mirage. Then a storm
  broke out and the rain made bubbles on the ground, which soon disappeared. The monks
  reflected on the mirage and the bubbles, comparing it to their own bodies. Very
  soon they all attained Arahantship. When they related the matter to the Buddha he
  uttered this verse, saying that this form of meditation was very good and one is
  able to reach the goal quickly.
171: Prince Abhaya was sent to repress some rebellion at the frontier. He did this
  job very successfully and so king Bimbisara gave him the honor of a ruler for seven
  days. He was also given a young dancing girl for entertainment. But on the seventh
  day the girl died from exhaustion. The prince was very shocked and sad. He went
  to see the Buddha, who consoled him with this verse, saying that we should not be
  attached to worldly things.
172: There was a monk named Sammunjjani. He spent most of his time inside the monastery,
  sweeping the premises. Venerable Revata was staying at the same monastery, practicing
  meditation. Sammunjjani thought Revata to be very lazy and one day confronted him
  and asked him if he did not think it would be proper for him to help him to sweep
  the monastery. Revata replied, that a monk should sweep for a short time in the
  morning and then should practice meditation and try to perceive the true nature
  of things in order to reach Awakenment. Sammunjjani closely followed this advice
  and in a very short time he became an Arahant. Some other monks then asked him why
  he did not sweep as much as before. Sammunjjani replied that when he was negligent,
  he was sweeping all the time, but now he was mindful and so does not sweep so often.
  The monks went to the Buddha and reported to him, that Sammunjjani claims to be
  an Arahant. The Buddha confirmed, that Sammunjjani indeed reached the Awakenment
  and added this verse for the benefit of others.
173: In Kosala there lived a Brahmin, who was in the court of King Pasenadi. He had
  a son Ahimsaka. His father sent him to the famous city of Taksasila for studies.
  He was very intelligent and obedient and so his teacher and his wife liked him very
  much. But other students were jealous of him and so accused him of having an affair
  with teacher's wife. The teacher, being told the same story from number of people,
  started to believe it. But he did not want to kill Ahimsaka. He came up with another
  idea. At the end of the studies, it was a custom for the students to give presents
  to teachers and thank them for their effort. Ahimsaka's teacher told him to kill
  one thousand people and bring him a garland made of one thousand fingers. Ahimsaka
  had no other choice, but to start killing. He started to wear the garland around
  his neck to keep track of the number of fingers. He therefore became known as Angulimala
  ("Finger-garland"). The king dispatched some soldiers to catch him. When his mother
  heard about this, she went into the forest in search of her son. By that time, Angulimala's
  garland had nine hundred and ninety-nine fingers on it; just one finger was missing.
  The Buddha realized that if he did not intervene, Angulimala would kill his own
  mother in his desperation to make up the one thousand. So he went to the forest
  himself. When Angulimala saw the Buddha, he ran after him with his knife. But no
  matter ho quickly he ran, the Buddha always stayed ahead of him. Finally, he cried,
  "O monk, stop!" The Buddha replied, "I have stopped, it is you who has to stop!"
  Angulimala was confused and asked him what he meant. The Buddha explained, that
  he himself has stopped killing and hurting all living beings whereas Angulimala
  has not and should therefore stop. Angulimala realized his mistake and asked the
  Buddha to admit him into the Order of monks. The Buddha did so. When the king heard
  that Angulimala has given up his evil deeds and was now living as a monk, he decided
  not to prosecute him. Angulimala practiced meditation diligently and in the due
  course he attained Arahantship. But his past evil deeds were always hunting him.
  Whenever he went on an almsround, he became a target of stones and sticks and returned
  to the monastery with broken head and bleeding. The Buddha always told him to realize
  what suffering would await him in his future lives had he not reached the Awakenment.
  One day, Angulimala saw a pregnant woman giving birth and in great pains. He recited,
  "Sister, since the day I became an Arahant, I have not consciously killed any living
  being. By the power of this truth, may you and your child be well." The woman delivered
  instantly and her pain ceased. This verse became known as Angulimala-paritta and
  is used in similar cases to this day. When Angulimala died, other monks asked about
  his future life. When the Buddha declared, that Angulimala has attained Arahantship
  and therefore there were no future lives for him, some monks were surprises, how
  was it possible for somebody who killed so many people to have reached the goal
  so quickly? The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that Angulimala's evil deeds
  were negated by his diligent and mindful practice of meditation and highly moral
  life.
174: 'The Buddha once stayed in Alavi and spoke to its people about the impermanence
  of life. He told them to be aware of death and to reflect that their life is uncertain.
  He added that they should practice mindfulness as a weapon against the death. Many
  people did not really understand what he was talking about, but some did. Amongst
  them there was a young girl, who was a weaver by profession. Later the Buddha returned
  to Alavi. The girl wanted to hear his discourse, but her father asked her to wind
  some thread spools and bring them to him. She did the job quickly and on the way
  to her father she stopped by the place where the Buddha was talking and listened.
  The Buddha knew that the girl was ready to reach the first stage of Awakenment and
  so he looked at her directly. The girl approached respectfully. The Buddha then
  asked her four questions and she replied as follows: "Where have you come from?"
  "I don''t know." "Where are you going?" "I don''t know." "Don''t you know?" "Yes,
  I know." "Do you know?" "I don''t know." Many people thought her answers were disrespectful,
  but the girl explained. By the first question the Buddha meant if she knew what
  was her previous existence. She replied that she did not know. The second question
  meant if she knew what would be her future existence. Since she did not know, she
  said so. The third question meant if she did not know that she would die one day.
  She replied she knew. And the last question meant if she knew when exactly would
  she die. She did not know and replied truthfully. The Buddha applauded her and delivered
  a discourse. The girl attained the first stage of Awakenment. Then she continued
  to her father. He was asleep and she woke him up. When he was waking up, her father
  accidentally pulled the shuttle and the sharp point hit the girl in her chest. She
  died instantly and was reborn in the Tusita heaven. Her father, full of remorse
  and broken-hearted went to the Buddha and asked to be admitted into the Order as
  a monk. The Buddha granted him permission and the man attained Arahantship soon.'
175: At one occasion, thirty monks came to visit the Buddha. While they were talking,
  the Buddha’s attendant, Venerable Ananda, went outside. When he came back he was
  surprised to see no monks inside. When asked, the Buddha said that they left flying
  through the air, because they attained Arahantship, including supernatural powers.
  Just then, the Buddha saw some swans flying in the sky and told Ananda that Arahants
  leave this world just as easily as the swans fly through the air.
176: The Buddha did not have only admirers and devotees. Some other teachers hated
  him for being so famous and for taking many disciples away from them. One such teacher
  instigated a beautiful young girl, a pupil of his, to ruin the Buddha's fame. The
  girl, named Cibca Manavika, would go towards the Jetavana monastery in the evening
  and return early in the morning, claiming she spent the night with the Buddha. After
  several months of this behavior, she started wrapping cloth around her stomach.
  She added more and more cloth to create an impression she was pregnant. Finally
  she went to the monastery to confront the Buddha. She accused him of making her
  pregnant and not caring about her. The Buddha told her not to lie, but she would
  just repeat her statements. Just then Sakka, the king of gods, sent some rats to
  bit off the strings of the cloth the girl had wrapped around her body. It fell off
  and her deceit was uncovered. People started to reprimand her and she ran away in
  shame. Later she died due to an accident. The next day some monks were discussing
  this story and the Buddha replied them with this verse, saying that lying is the
  first step towards all kinds of evil deeds. He also told them, that Cibca Manavika
  was a king's consort in one of her previous lives. She fell in love with a crown
  prince, but the young man did not respond to her love. She harmed herself and accused
  the prince of making advances to her and when she refused, he harmed her. The king
  was very angry and exiled his son immediately. Later he found out the truth and
  punished the evil woman.
177: King Pasenadi of Kosala was once competing with his subjects in almsgiving. However
  big offering the king made, his subjects always found a way to give more alms. Queen
  Mallika then devised a plan. She had a great pavilion built, brought many white
  umbrellas and tame elephants. The elephants held the umbrellas over the monks. In
  the middle of the pavilion there was a lake with ten boats filled with incense and
  perfume. Finally, princesses served the food. Because the subjects had no elephants
  or umbrellas (white umbrellas could be owned only by kings) and of course had no
  princesses, they could not compete any more. Two ministers of the king were present.
  One of them praised the king for offering so much. He realized that the merit would
  be shared by all the living beings in the kingdom. The other minister however thought
  that the king was giving away the national wealth for the sake of some lazy monks.
  After the meal, the Buddha prepared to make a speech. He understood what the second
  minister was feeling and so he decided to give only a short speech instead of a
  long one he was originally planning. The king was disappointed by such a brief sermon
  and he reflected what he had done wrong. Therefore he went to the monastery and
  asked the Buddha. The Buddha told him about one of his ministers and explained that
  had he delivered a long speech, the minister would be disappointed even more. The
  Buddha further added this verse for the benefit of the king.
178: Anathapindika was a very famous benefactor of the Buddha and his followers. But
  his son Kala did not have any interest in the teaching of the Buddha and would never
  come to attend the almsgiving ceremonies. His father was afraid that Kala would
  never be able to understand the Dharma. So he promised his son one hundred pieces
  of gold if he went to the monastery for one day. The young man did so, but did not
  pay any attention to what was being said there. At another time Anathapindika promised
  Kala one thousand pieces of gold if he could recite one verse of the Buddha's teaching.
  Because the Buddha knew Kala was interested only in the money, he made it impossible
  for him to memorize anything. Thus Kala went to the monastery very often and gradually
  he was able to understand the Dharma and attained the first level of Awakenment,
  called Entering the Stream. In the morning of that day, he accompanied the Buddha
  and some monks to his father's house for the almsgiving. When his father offered
  him the money he earned, Kala refused. The Buddha then explained that since Kala
  attained the first level of Awakenment, he was on longer interested in the money.
  He further added this verse, saying that Entering the Stream was the best thing
  one could attain, far better than any worldly power or even attainment of a rebirth
  in heavens.
179: In the Kuru country there lived a Brahmin named Magandiya. He had a very beautiful
  daughter. Many young men desired to marry her, but her father turned all of them
  down, thinking they were not good enough for her. One morning, Magandiya went to
  perform his daily fire worship. On the way he met the Buddha. Immediately he decided,
  that the Buddha would be an ideal husband for his daughter. Quickly he returned
  home and took his wife and daughter with him back to the place he met the Buddha.
  In the meantime, the Buddha left his footprints at that place and went to another
  spot nearby. When Magandiya's wife saw the footprints, she remarked, that these
  footprints belong to somebody, who has given up all cravings. But her husband did
  not pay any attention to that and proceeded to find the Buddha and offer his daughter
  to him. The Buddha said he was not interested. He told them how the beautiful daughters
  of Mara tried to seduce him. He gave up all passions, all cravings, and all attachments.
  Even when he saw the most beautiful women - the daughters of Mara, he felt no desire.
  Compared with them, Magandiya's daughter was nothing - why should he want even to
  touch her? Both the Brahmin and his wife attained the third stage of Awakenment
  on hearing these words. Later they became a monk and a nun and soon attained Arahantship.
  But their daughter, Magandiya, felt insulted and promised to take revenge on the
  Buddha.
180: The commentarial story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous
  verse (see DhP 179). As the Buddha has eradicated all cravings, destroyed all roots
  of evil, these cannot "lead" him anywhere, there are no more rebirths for him. Nobody
  can trace him or destroy him.
181: Once, when the Buddha was staying in Savatthi, he was challenged by some other
  ascetics to perform a miracle. He therefore performed the Twin Miracle and proceeded
  to the Tavatimsa heaven to teach Abhidharma there. His mother had been reborn in
  the Tusita heaven, but went to Tavatimsa to learn the Teaching. After hearing the
  Dharma from the Buddha, his mother together with many other gods reached the first
  level of Awakenment. The Buddha spent three months in Tavatimsa. Venerable Sariputta
  was spending the Rain Retreat in Samkassa and taught the Abhidharma, as the Buddha
  instructed him. At the end of the Retreat Venerable Moggallana went to Tavatimsa
  to see the Buddha and was informed that the Buddha would be coming back to Samkassa
  on the fool moon day at the end of the Rain Retreat. On that day the Buddha appeared,
  six colored rays shining from his body. A great number of gods accompanied him and
  paid his homage to him before they left. Sariputta exclaimed how magnificent the
  gods looked and how extraordinary that both human beings and gods respect the Buddha
  so much. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that indeed even the gods envy
  a buddha his qualities.
182: 'During the times of the past Buddha Kassapa, there was a monk. Once he committed
  a wrong deed and was tormented by regret. He was not able to overcome this and concentrate
  on his practice. Therefore he made no progress and was reborn as a Naga. Nagas are
  mythological beings, snakes that can change into humans. They are believed to have
  miraculous powers. This Naga''s name was Erakapatta. He had a beautiful daughter.
  He announced that whoever could answer her questions, could marry her. Many young
  men tried but nobody was successful. Once a young man named Uttara was on his way
  to try to answer the questions. The Buddha saw that he was very close to attaining
  the first stage of Awakenment, therefore he taught him answers to the questions.
  Immediately, Uttara attained the first stage. As a result, he had no longer desire
  for the Naga princess. But he still went there to answer her questions. The girl
  asked: "Who is a ruler? Uttara replied: "Who controls his six senses." "Is someone
  overpowered by moral defilements to be called a ruler?" "No, only who is free from
  moral defilements can be called a ruler." "What ruler is free from moral defilements?"
  "One who is free from selfishness." "Who is to be called a fool?" "One who strives
  after sensual pleasures is a fool." Uttara then answered many more questions. When
  Erakapatta found out that somebody was able to answer, he realized that a Buddha
  was again in this world. He asked Uttara to take him to the Buddha. There he paid
  homage to the Buddha and related his story. The Buddha replied with this verse,
  saying that it is extremely rare to be born as a human being, and even rarer to
  be able to hear the Dharma from the mouth of a Buddha. At the end of the discourse
  many monks attained Arahantship or at least the first stage of Awakenment.'
183: This gatha, simply said, is Buddhism in a nutshell. Truly, what can be explained
  and expanded in hundreds of books, can be also abbreviated into three main guidelines.
  Not doing evil deeds - the first step on the road to Awakenment. But what exactly
  are "evil deeds"? A deed is considered evil if it brings suffering to any living
  being. After one refrains from doing evil deeds one needs to do good deeds - to
  "gather" them like flowers. Good deeds are deeds that help living beings. They are
  based on loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity. In order to
  be able to do so, one must cultivate these feelings in one's heart and mind. These
  two steps are only preparatory stages to the final and most important action - purification
  of mind. The first two stages are here to prepare our mind for the highest goal.
  Without them it would be indeed impossible to purify our minds, for a mind that
  harbors evil thoughts can not purify itself. The last verse mentions that this is
  the teaching of the buddhas. Why is the plural form used here? The historical Buddha
  Shakyamuni is believed to be just one from the long succession of Awakened beings,
  buddhas, who reach the nirvana by themselves and the become teachers of the Dharma.
  And as this verse states, their teachings might differ, but these three basic patterns
  do not change in either of them. Therefore, these lines can truly be described as
  the very core of Buddha's teaching.
184: Venerable Ananda once asked the Buddha if the basic instructions for the behavior
  of the monks were the same in case of the past Buddhas, or if each Awakened One
  sets his own rules. The Buddha replied with this verse and with the preceding one
  (DhP 183) and with the following one (DhP 185), saying that they were all the same.
  He also added that the previous Buddhas uttered these three verses also.
185: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous two verses
  (DhP 183, DhP 184). These three verses have been recited by the Buddhas of all times.
  It is a simple and basic summarization of most essential Buddhist teaching. Wanting
  little, content, not hurting others, moral life in seclusion and meditation in order
  to reach the highest goal, the Nirvana, complete freedom and emancipation of the
  mind.
186: At the Jetavana monastery there was a young monk. His teacher sent him to another
  monastery to practice meditation. While he was away, his father died and left some
  money for him with his brother. When the monk returned, he found out about this,
  but decided to continue living as a monk and told his brother to keep the money
  for himself. Later, however, he began to regret, started to imagine his comfortable
  life as a layman with that amount of money. He became dissatisfied with his life
  as a monk and began loosing weight. Other monks persuaded him to seek help from
  the Buddha. The Buddha told the monk this verse (and the following one, see DhP
  187), saying that there is simply never enough money to satisfy the hunger. He told
  him the story of a king named Mandhatu, who had been a Universal Monarch a long
  time ago. He was reborn in Tavatimsa heaven and enjoyed immense riches and power
  for a long time. Then he started to wish he were the only ruler of Tavatimsa instead
  of Sakka, the king of the gods. Immediately he died and fell down from his heavenly
  state. The young monk decided to continue his life as a monk and strived diligently
  to attain the Awakenment.
187: 'The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  187). It is a well-known fact that people are never satisfied with what they have.
  Even millionaires want to become billionaires; even kings want to become emperors.
  So the Buddha''s message is rather simple: be satisfied with little and rather strive
  for the spiritual perfection, do not wish for worldly possessions.'
188: 'When the father of the king Pasenadi of Kosala, Maha Kosala, was reigning, he
  had a head priest, named Aggidatta. When Maha Kosala died, Aggidatta gave up his
  position and wealth and became an ascetic. He had many followers and lived on the
  border of Anga, Magadha and Kuru countries. His teaching to the people was: pay
  homage to forests, mountains, trees and shrines. By doing so, you will be freed
  from all evils. Once the Buddha sent Venerable Moggallana to teach the Dharma to
  Aggidatta. When Moggallana arrived, he asked for a place to spend the night. They
  refused to let him stay with them. Close to that place was a cave where lived a
  very powerful Naga and Aggidatta sent Moggallana there, thinking Naga would kill
  him. Moggallana and the Naga had a duel, but at the end the Naga was subdued and
  spread his hood over Moggallana''s head, showing him respect. In the morning, Aggidatta
  and his pupils went to the cave to find out what happened. When they saw the Naga
  holding his head over Moggallana, they were surprised and paid respects to Moggallana.
  When the Buddha arrived there, Moggallana got up from his seat and paid homage to
  the Buddha, saying that he was only a disciple, the Buddha was his teacher. When
  Aggidatta heard that, his respect for the Buddha was only greater. The Buddha admonished
  them with this verse (and following ones, DhP 189, DhP 190, DhP 191, DhP 192), saying
  that trees and mountains are not a real refuge; only the Three Gems (Buddha, Dharma,
  Sangha) are the highest refuge. Aggidatta and his pupils attained Arahantship immediately.
  They all became monks. Later, lay disciples of Aggidatta came to that place and
  were confused. Who was more powerful? Aggidatta or the Buddha? Aggidatta got up
  from his seat and paid homage to the Buddha, saying that he was only a humble disciple,
  the Buddha was the highest teacher.'
189: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the preceding verse (DhP
  188) and the following ones (DhP 190, DhP 191, DhP 192). Trees or mountains are
  not liberated from the round of rebirths. Neither are the protective gods that may
  inhabit them. Therefore, taking these things as a refuge will not help us in the
  goal, liberation of mind from the round of rebirths, the Samsara.
190: 'The story for this verse is identical with the one for the preceding verses
  (DhP 188, DhP 189) and the following ones (DhP 191, DhP 192). The Triple Gem, the
  Buddha (Awakened One), the Dharma (his teaching) and the Sangha (the community of
  his followers) are the highest possible refuge, because the Buddha has reached Awakenment,
  the Dharma is the teaching how to reach this goal and the Sangha is the community
  of people who are on the way to reach it. Having taken refuge in this Triple Gem,
  one can clearly see the Four Noble Truths, the most important of all the Buddhist
  teachings. They are: 1) The truth of Suffering, 2) The truth of Origin of Suffering,
  3) The truth of Extinction of Suffering and 4) The truth of the Path, leading to
  the Extinction of Suffering.'
191: 'The story for this verse is identical with the one for the preceding verses
  (DhP 188, DhP 189, DhP 190) and the following one (DhP 192). These are so called
  Four Noble Truths, one of the most important teachings of the Buddha. They are:
  1) The Truth of Suffering: everything in this world is connected with pain and suffering.
  2) The truth of Origin of Suffering: the root of suffering is our craving. 3) The
  truth of Extinction of Suffering: by destroying the craving we also destroy all
  the suffering. 4) The truth of the Path, leading to the Extinction of Suffering:
  this can be done by following the Noble Eightfold Path: Right View, Right Thought,
  Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right
  Concentration.'
192: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the preceding verses (DhP
  188, DhP 189, DhP 190, DhP 191). Because the Buddha is free from the round of rebirths,
  his teaching can lead us in the same direction. And in the community of his followers
  we can help each other to reach this goal. Then we will be able to see the Four
  Noble Truths and lead our lives according to the Noble Eightfold Path. If we mindfully
  strive for the highest goal, surely we will reach it. Therefore, the Buddha, Dharma
  and Sangha are the highest possible refuge, because by following them, we can attain
  the Awakenment and reach freedom from suffering and the round of rebirths.
193: Venerable Ananda was once pondering about what the Buddha said. Thoroughbreds
  of elephants are born only amongst Chaddanta and Uposatha breeds, thoroughbred horses
  amongst Sindh breed, and thoroughbreds of cattle amongst Usabha breed. But the Buddha
  said nothing about thoroughbreds of people. So Ananda decided to ask the Buddha.
  The Buddha told him that noble people are not born in any particular family. But
  wherever they are born, that family is very lucky indeed.
194: 'Some monks were discussing what is the true happiness. Everybody defined the
  word in different way and so they realized that happiness could mean completely
  dissimilar things to different people. For some, money and fame were happiness,
  for some sensual pleasures, for some good food… They asked the Buddha what the true
  happiness really was. He replied them with this verse, saying that only these things
  constitute real happiness: arising of a Buddha in this world, opportunity to hear
  the Dharma, unity and harmony amongst monks.'
195: The Buddha was once on a journey with many monks, when they came to a field,
  which had a Brahmanic shrine nearby. A Brahmin was ploughing the field. Then the
  Brahmin came to the Buddha, but he paid his respects to the shrine, not to the Buddha.
  The Buddha praised him for this deed but then told him that there were people and
  objects more worthy of devotion. He made appear a golden stupa of Kassapa Buddha.
  He then explained that there were four classes of people worthy of a stupa. They
  are the Fully Awakened Buddhas, the Pacceka Buddhas (who are also awakened but lack
  the power to teach the Dharma), the disciples who have reached Awakenment and Universal
  Monarchs. The Buddha further revealed that there could be three types of stupas.
  The stupas with corporeal relics of such people inside, the figures and statues
  of them and the personal effects such as robes or bowls these people used. These
  people and objects are truly worthy of veneration. At the end of the discourse,
  the Brahmin attained the first stage of Awakenment. The golden stupa remained visible
  for seven days and many people came to pay their respects. After seven days the
  stupa disappeared and a stone stupa was erected in its place.
196: The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous one (DhP
  195). It is important to pay respects to those who are most worthy of it. That means
  basically the Buddha and his followers. By paying our respects to them, we are able
  to gain the most merit. Paying respects to other people is also beneficial, but
  can never be as good as honoring the Buddha.
197: On the bank of the river Rohini there was the town of Kapilavatthu, where the
  Buddha's own relatives, Sakyans, lived. On the other side of that river there was
  the town of Koliya, where lived the Koliyans, who were also related to Sakyans.
  Both towns and farms around it used the water from Rohini River. One year there
  was a severe draught. There was not enough water for everybody. Both sides started
  to quarrel because of water. No compromise could be found so both sides prepared
  to fight. The Buddha found out about this and decided to stop the bloodshed. As
  both armies assembled on the riverbanks, the Buddha appeared in the middle. He then
  admonished them, that for the sake of water, which has little value, they were willing
  to sacrifice their lives, which were so precious and priceless! He further told
  them this verse and the two following ones (DhP 198, DhP 199). Both sides became
  ashamed and reached a compromise. Thus the war did not happen.
198: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  197) and also the following verse (DhP 198).
199: The story for this verse is identical with the story for the two previous verses
  (DhP 197, DhP 198).
200: The Buddha once saw that a group of young girls from Pabcasala village was very
  close to attaining the first stage of Awakenment. One day, when the girls were returning
  from the bath at the river, the Buddha entered the village for almsfood. However,
  the villagers were influenced by Mara and gave him nothing. When the Buddha left
  the village, he met Mara who asked him if he has received enough almsfood. The Buddha,
  knowing that Mara influenced the villagers, admonished him for doing such a wrong
  deed. Mara wanted to make further fun of the Buddha and so told him to go back to
  the village to ask for almsfood again. When the Buddha returned to the village,
  the girls came back from their bath and paid their homage to him. Mara appeared
  again and asked the Buddha if he was not quite hungry, not having eaten anything
  that day. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that even if he did not get
  any food at all, he would sustain himself on joy and satisfaction, like the Radiant
  Gods, who live in constant joy and happiness.
201: King Ajatasattu was the son of King Bimbisara and Queen Vedehi, the sister of
  the King of Kosala. Ajatasattu and the King of Kosala went to war three times. The
  King of Kosala was always defeated. Because of this, he was very depressed. He lamented
  that it was a terrible disgrace; he was not able to defeat Ajatasattu, who was very
  young and inexperienced. The King refused to eat and just stayed in his bed all
  the time. When the Buddha learned about this, he admonished him with this verse.
  The King realized there was no victory in war and became the Buddha's devoted follower.
202: Once the Buddha was invited for almsfood to a house on the day the daughter of
  the family was getting married. Her bridegroom was very excited when he was observing
  her bringing almsfood and as a result he was not able to pay any attention to what
  the Buddha said. The Buddha knew both the bride and the bridegroom were very close
  to realizing the Dharma and so he willed for the bridegroom not to see the bride
  and vice versa. Both young people then were able to pay attention to the Buddha's
  words. He told them this verse. Reflecting on the meaning of the verse both the
  bride and the bridegroom realized the Dharma and became lay followers of the Buddha.
203: Once the Buddha came to the village of Alavi. On that day, one poor man had lost
  his ox and he spent the whole morning looking for it everywhere. The villagers offered
  almsfood to the Buddha and monks. After the meal, everybody got ready to listen
  to the Dharma, but the Buddha waited for the poor man, because he knew the man was
  very close to attaining the first stage of Awakenment. When the man found his ox,
  he came back to the village. He was very tired and hungry. So the Buddha directed
  the villagers to let him eat first and only then he expounded the Dharma. At the
  end of the discourse, the poor man attained the first stage of Awakenment. Later
  the monks asked the Buddha why he waited for the man before he delivered the discourse.
  The Buddha told them that the man was very hungry and very tired and if he had not
  eaten, he might not be able to comprehend the Dharma fully and reach the first stage
  of Awakenment.
204: The King Pasenadi of Kosala once came to the monastery to hear the Dharma. But
  on that day he ate too much and as a result he was sleepy, did not pay much attention
  and was only sitting there and nodding. Seeing him, the Buddha advised him not to
  overeat, because moderation in food brings comfort to the body. Pasenadi did as
  he was told and after a time he lost some weight, was more fit and began to feel
  much better. The Buddha then told him this verse, saying that health is the greatest
  gain and we should do everything to attain it.
205: The Buddha announced that in four months he would attain his final Parinirvana
  (death of a Buddha or any fully Awakened person). Many monks who had not yet attained
  the Awakenment were sad and depressed. They all came to the presence of the Buddha
  and paid him their respects. But Venerable Tissa decided that he would pay the highest
  honor to the Buddha by attaining the Awakenment while he was still alive. Therefore
  he went to the secluded place in the forest and practiced meditation diligently.
  Other monks did not understand his intentions and reported to the Buddha that Tissa
  had no respect for him and kept to himself instead of coming to pay his respects
  to the teacher. The Buddha told them that Tissa was striving to attain Awakenment
  before the teacher died and then explained that this was the best way to honor the
  Buddha. The best salutation to the Buddha is practicing the Dharma diligently. At
  the end, the Buddha told the monks this verse.
206: Ten months before he reached the Parinirvana, the Buddha was staying at the village
  of Beluva. While he was there, he got sick. He suffered from dysentery. Sakka, the
  King of the Gods, personally came to attend to him. The Buddha told him there were
  many monks who could help him around, but Sakka insisted on helping the Buddha personally.
  The monks were very surprised to find Sakka attending to the Buddha. The Buddha
  told them there was nothing surprising about this. In his previous life, Sakka heard
  the Dharma just for a short while, moments before he died. As a result, he was born
  as the present Sakka, the King of the Gods. Then the Buddha told the monks this
  verse and two following ones (DhP 207, DhP 208).
207: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  206) and the following one (DhP 208). The company of fools is not good for someone
  who wants to achieve his spiritual goal. In the company of fools we will learn nothing
  new, nothing important or good. We will only stagnate and eventually we will become
  just one of the fools.
208: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous verses
  (DhP 206 and DhP 207). As the moon follows and "associates with" the stars on the
  night sky, so should people who want to reach the highest goal follow and associate
  with only the best companions, who can teach one a lot on the way to the spiritual
  progress.
209: A young man from Savatthi became a monk. Both his parents were very strongly
  attached to their son, so they left home too. But even in the monastery they could
  not live without each other. They stayed together, ate together, all day only talking,
  as if they were still at home. When the Buddha heard this, he admonished them strongly
  that by becoming monks and a nun, they should leave behind all worldly attachments.
  He also told them this verse as well as the two following ones (DhP 210, DhP 211).
210: The story of this verse is identical with the one for the previous (DhP 209)
  and the following (DhP 211) verses. Meeting people one does not like is truly suffering.
  Therefore we should avoid seeing them at all. But what about the ones we love? We
  suffer when they are away or when they die. So, it is best to avoid meeting them
  too and rather concentrate on the goal and meditate with strong effort.
211: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous ones
  (DhP 209, DhP 210). To be separated from the ones we love is painful. Therefore
  we should not hold anything dear. In this way, when we do not love or hate anything
  or anybody, there are no bonds for us and we can reach Awakenment.
212: One rich man had a son and loved him very much. The son got ill and died. The
  man was extremely depressed. Every day he went to the cemetery and wept there. Once
  the Buddha met him there and asked what happened. The rich man told the Buddha about
  his son. The Buddha consoled him with this verse, saying that since everything and
  everybody must die, we should not be attached to people and things. The rich man
  immediately attained the first stage of Awakenment.
213: Visakha, a famous benefactress of the Buddha and his followers, had a granddaughter,
  who died suddenly. Visakha was very sad and she came to see the Buddha and expressed
  her feelings. The Buddha told her to realize how many people died every day only
  in the city of Savatthi. If we were to regard all of them as our children and grandchildren,
  we would be weeping all day. He also told Visakha this verse, saying that sorrow
  arises out of love.
214: Once the Buddha with some monks entered the city of Vesali during a festival
  day. On their way they met some local princes, all dressed up in beautiful clothes.
  The Buddha told the monks to look at the princes, because they resemble the gods
  from Tavatimsa heaven. On their way to the garden, the ptrinces met a beautiful
  courtesan. They invited her to join them. But they started to quarrel over her and
  soon they were fighting. At the end some of them had to be carried home bleeding.
  The Buddha told the monks this verse, saying that grief and sorrow are born from
  affection and sensual pleasures.
215: In Savatthi there lived a young man named Anitthi Gandha Kumara. He was to marry
  a beautiful young girl from Sagala. But the bride got ill and died on her way to
  his house. The man became very sad, grieving all the time. The Buddha came to his
  house one day and after being offered almsfood, he asked for the reason of his sorrow.
  The young man told him the story of his ruined marriage. The Buddha replied him
  with this verse, saying that from pleasure and lust, only pain and sorrow can come
  out. The young man attained the first stage of Awakenment.
216: In Savatthi there lived a brahmin. He was not a follower of the Buddha. But because
  the Buddha knew he head the ability to attain the first stage of Awakenment, he
  went to the field where the brahmin was ploughing his field. The brahmin was very
  friendly and they talked many times. Every time the Buddha would visit him, the
  brahmin kept telling him he would offer him some rice after the harvest. The Buddha
  said nothing; because he knew this year the brahmin would get no harvest at all.
  One day there was a heavy rain and all the rice was destroyed. The brahmin was sad,
  because now he could not fulfill his promise. But the Buddha told him this verse,
  saying that only because of thirst and craving there is suffering and pain. The
  brahmin attained the first stage of Awakenment.
217: One day the Buddha with some monks went to the city of Rajagaha to obtain some
  almsfood. On the way they met a group of young boys with a basket full of cakes.
  The boys paid their respects to the Buddha but they did not offer him any cakes.
  Just then Venerable Kassapa came along. The boys immediately offered the cakes to
  him. Kassapa then advised the boys to offer some cakes to the Buddha and they did
  so. Later, some monks wondered why the boys liked Kassapa so much. The Buddha replied
  with this verse, saying that whoever has so many good qualities like Kassapa, is
  always liked by people and gods.
218: There was an old monk who had many disciples. Many times they asked him about
  his attainments, but he never said anything. He has attained the third stage of
  Awakenment, but he decided he would not say anything, until he attained the full
  Awakenment. But he passed away without attaining the Arahantship and never told
  his pupils anything. The disciples thought their teacher had not attained any stage
  of Awakenment and fell very sorry. They asked the Buddha about this matter. The
  Buddha told him their teacher had actually attained the third stage, called Anagami
  (never coming back again). He was reborn in high abodes of the Brahma heaven, never
  to come back to this world again. He would eventually reach the Awakenment there.
  The Buddha also told the students why their teacher never said anything - he was
  modest and also a bit ashamed he head not reached the full Arahantship. The Buddha
  also added this verse, describing their teacher.
219: In the city of Benares there lived a rich man named Nandiya. Once he listened
  to the Buddha’s discourse on the benefits of giving. He built a monastery and furnished
  it. Immediately a mansion came up for him in the Tavatimsa heaven, awaiting him.
  Venerable Moggallana once visited the Tavatimsa world and saw the mansion built
  there for Nandiya. When he returned back, he asked the Buddha about this. The Buddha
  replied with this verse (and the following one, DhP 220), saying that the good deeds
  await the well-doer in the next world as surely as the relatives and friends await
  somebody who is long away from home.
220: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  219). Just like the rich man Nandiya from the story, we will reap the fruit of our
  good deeds - if not in this life, then in the next one. Our good deeds will "welcome"
  us immediately and we will be able to taste their outcome. Maybe we will have a
  mansion in heaven, like Nandiya. Or maybe we will be just a little bit wiser and
  more able to strive for our Awakenment.
221: 'There are ten fetters (sajyojana). They can be divided into two kinds, five
  so called "lower" or "big" fetters and five "higher" or "small" fetters. The five
  big fetters are: 1) personality belief (sakkaya-ditthi), 2) skeptical doubt (vicikiccha),
  3) clinging to rules and rituals (silabbata-paramasa), 4) sensuous craving (kama-raga),
  5) ill-will (vyapada). The five small fetters are: 1) craving for fine-material
  existence (rupa-raga), 2) craving for immaterial existence (arupa-raga), 3) conceit
  (mana), 4) restlessness (uddhacca), 5) ignorance (avijja). Venerable Anuruddha once
  came to Kapilavatthu to see his relatives. All of them came to meet him; only his
  sister Rohini did not come. Anuruddha asked about her and learned that she was suffering
  from a skin disease. Anuruddha sent for her and told her to perform some meritorious
  deeds. Rohini began to build a community hall. Even before the construction was
  completed, she started to sweep it every day and fill the water pots. She began
  to feel better immediately. When the hall was finished, the Buddha and monks were
  invited for an almsfood there. After the meal the Buddha asked Rohini to come. He
  then revealed, that she was suffering because of evil deed done in one of her previous
  lives. She was the queen of Benares. The king had a dancer he liked very much. The
  queen became jealous and instructed her servants to put some itching powder into
  the dancer''s bed. Thus the dancer itched all over and when she went to bed to rest,
  her condition got even worse. The Buddha then exhorted her and all the people present
  to give up anger and pride and not to cling to anything. He further added this verse.
  Rohini and some other people attained full Awakenment immediately. At the same time
  Rohini''s disease was cured and her skin became smooth and clear.'
222: Once a certain monk wanted to build a hut for himself. He chose a tree and was
  about to cut it down. But a spirit lived in that tree with her son. The spirit asked
  the monk not to cut down their tree, but the monk did not listen. So the spirit
  put her son on the tree, hoping this would prevent the monk from cutting the tree
  down. But the monk's ax was already swinging down and he was unable to stop it.
  The ax fell and cut of the baby's arm. The spirit became very angry and was about
  to kill the monk. But then she reflected and decided not to harm the monk, because
  she would acquire a lot of demerit. So instead, she went to see the Buddha and told
  him all what happened. The Buddha told her this verse, praising her for her self-control.
  He then taught her the Dharma. After reflecting on what was taught, the spirit realized
  the Dharma. She was offered a new tree to live in, in vicinity of the monastery.
  After this incident, the Buddha made a new rule for the monks, forbidding them to
  hurt plant life.
223: In Savathi there lived a rich man named Sumana. He had a servant named Punna.
  Once Punna and his wife offered almsfood to Venerable Sariputta and as a result
  of this deed, Punna found gold in the field he was ploughing. The king declared
  him to be the royal banker and the whole family became extremely rich and influential.
  Once Punna and his family were offering almsfood to the Buddha and the monks for
  seven days. After hearing the Dharma from the Buddha the whole family, Punna, his
  wife and their daughter Uttara, attained the Awakenment. Uttara got married to the
  son of Sumana. Because the family was not Buddhist, she was not able to perform
  meritorious deeds. Her father sent her some money and arranged for a woman named
  Sirima to look after the household for a few days. During this time, Uttara was
  offering almsfood to the Buddha and the monks. When her husband saw her, he smiled,
  because he did not understand the significance of giving and thought her stupid.
  But Sirima, seeing him smile, forgot she was there only for a few days, and became
  jealous. She brought some boiling oil with the intention to pour it over the head
  of Uttara. Uttara knew what was about to happen but she did not feel any anger or
  hatred. She was very grateful to Sirima, because only with her help was she able
  to perform meritorious deeds. She made a firm resolution not to let any anger or
  hatred enter her mind. The boiling oil then became harmless, like cold water. Sirima
  did not understand and went to get another pot of hot oil. But by then other servants
  caught her and beat her up. Then Sirima realized what she had done and asked Uttara
  for forgiveness. Uttara told her to go to see "her father" - she meant the Buddha,
  who has taught her the Dharma and helped her to reach the Awakenment. The Buddha
  listened to all what happened. Then he praised Uttara for not feeling any anger
  or hatred. He told her this verse. At the end, Uttara forgave Sirima.
224: Venerable Moggallana once visited the heaven world and asked the gods what good
  deeds had they done to be reborn in such happy state. Different gods had different
  answers. One was reborn as a god only because he always spoke truth. Another goddess
  said that she was a servant who never got angry with her master and never hated
  him, although he beat and abused her. Some gods replied they offered what little
  they could for the benefit of others. Moggallana returned back and asked the Buddha
  if it was really possible to be reborn as a god just by these deeds. The Buddha
  confirmed it and spoke this verse, saying even little good deeds lead to heaven.
225: 'The Buddha was once in the city of Saketa for almsfood. While he was passing
  a certain brahmin’s house, the brahmin welcomed him: "Son, we have not seen you
  for a long time. Come and visit us again!" When the Buddha entered the house, the
  brahmin''s wife also welcomed him as a long lost son. From that day, they offered
  almsfood to the Buddha. The monks asked why did they call the Buddha their son.
  The Buddha explained that he had been their son for a great many lives in the past.
  The Buddha stayed with them for three months and both the brahmin and his wife attained
  the Awakenment. Later the monks asked where were they reborn, since they did not
  know the couple had already reached the Nirvana. The Buddha replied with this verse,
  saying that the Arahants are not reborn anywhere, they have attained the Nirvana.'
226: 'There was a young slave girl, named Punna. One night she was doing some work
  for her master, when she saw some monks going to their rooms after listening to
  the Dharma. She pondered that she was up so late because she was poor and had to
  work hard. But she could not think about any reason for the monks to be up so late
  as well. The next day she made for herself a simple rice cake and went to the riverside
  to rest and eat. But on the way she met the Buddha and offered the cake to him.
  The Buddha accepted and ate the cake. After eating, the Buddha told her why the
  monks were up so late: they were always vigilant and learning something, no matter
  what time it was. He also tolf her this verse, saying that by being always watchful
  and mindful, one can eradicate one''s taints. Punna immediately realized the Dharma.
  Traditionally, these four taints (asava) are mentioned in the texts: sense desire
  (kama), desiring eternal existence (bhava), wrong views (ditthi) and ignorance (avijja).'
227: There was a man named Atula. Once he and his friends wanted to hear the Dharma.
  They went to see Venerable Revata. But he was practicing meditation and did not
  tell them anything. They were disappointed and so went to see Venerable Sariputta.
  He expounded the Dharma in length, telling them many profound teachings they did
  not quite understand. Still unhappy, they went to Venerable Ananda. He explained
  shortly basic teachings of the Buddha. Atula and his friends then went to see the
  Buddha. They complained. Revata did not say anything at all, Sariputta spoke too
  much and Ananda too little. After such a long time, they still were not satisfied.
  The Buddha replied with this verse (and the following ones, DhP 228, DhP 229 and
  DhP 230), saying that, as before, so today, there is no one who is never blamed.
228: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  227) and the following verses (DhP 229, DhP 230). Even the best of people are always
  blamed by somebody for something. Gandhi was killed although he was very close to
  what we call "a saint". Therefore, even if we encounter someone who is hostile to
  us, we should not feel hatred or enmity.
229: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP
  227, DhP 228) and the following verse (DhP 230).
230: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP
  227, DhP 228 and DhP 229).
231: A group of six monks wearing wooden shoes and each holding a staff, were walking
  on a big stone, making a lot of noise and disturbing the peace of other monks. The
  Buddha asked Venerable Ananda what was going on and having learned about the six
  monks, he admonished them with this verse (and the following ones, DhP 232, DhP
  233 and DhP 234). He also made a new rule for the monks not to wear wooden shoes.
232: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  231) and the following ones (DhP 233, DhP 234). By this verse the Buddha stressed
  that both the right conduct in bodily deeds and the right conduct in verbal speech
  are equally important.
233: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP
  231, DhP 232) and the following one (DhP 234). Even the thinking is very important.
  Truly, mental action is probably the most important of the three (bodily, verbal,
  mental). The bodily and verbal actions are only byproducts of the mental action.
  Thinking comes first and only after that we act with our body or our mouth. Therefore,
  the key to controlling our bodily and verbal actions lays in controlling our minds.
234: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP
  231, DhP 232 and DhP 233).
235: In Savatthi there lived an old butcher. He was used to eating beef curry every
  day. Once he put aside some meat to be cooked that day and went for a bath. In the
  meantime, his wife saw the meat and sold it. Therefore, when the butcher returned
  home, he realized that there would be no meat that day. He was so angry that he
  went and cut off the tongue of an ox. He has his wife to prepare it and began to
  eat. When he tried to take bite of the tongue, he bit off his own tongue. The butcher
  died in great pain and agony and was reborn in a painful state. The butcher's son
  was afraid that this evil would befall him as well so he left the city and went
  to Taxila. He became a goldsmith, got married and had children. When he got old,
  he and his family moved back to Savatthi. His children were followers of the Buddha
  but he was not. The children were concerned for their father and so one day they
  invited the Buddha and monks for a meal. After the meal they told the Buddha that
  this offering was on behalf of their father. They asked the Buddha to give a discourse
  to the old man to help him to see the Dharma. The Buddha told the old goldsmith
  this verse (and the following ones, DhP 236, DhP 237 and DhP 238). At the end for
  the discourse, the old goldsmith attained the first stage of Awakenment.
236: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  235) and the following ones (DhP 237, DhP 238). We should strive and make the best
  effort in order to purify our minds and make the best of our lives. By doing this,
  we will reach "the place of the Noble Ones", the Nirvana, the complete purification
  of the mind.
237: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP
  235 and DhP 236) and the following one (DhP 238). Although this verse was originally
  told to an old man, it is actually true for all of us. We all are very close to
  death, even if we might be still young and healthy. Nobody ever knows the time of
  his death. Therefore, we all should make our best effort to overcome the defilements
  of our minds before it is too late.
238: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP
  235, DhP 236 and DhP 237). If we strive and exert ourselves, we will purify our
  minds, attain the Awakenment - and therefore there will be no more birth, sickness,
  aging and death for us. Then we do not have to fear the death any longer.
239: Once a brahmin saw a group of monks preparing to enter the city for almsfood.
  They were rearranging their robes in order to go to the city. The brahmin saw that
  the robes touched the ground and got wet because of dew. So he cleared that place
  of grass. The next day he saw that the ground is dirty and it soiled the robes.
  So he covered the place with sand. During the next few days he saw that when the
  sun is shining the monks sweat and when it rains, they get wet. Therefore he built
  a shelter at that place. When it was ready, the brahmin invited the Buddha and monks
  for an almsfood. He then explained how he performed this good deed gradually. The
  Buddha replied him with this verse, saying that one should use every little opportunity
  to perform good deeds and cleanse one's mind of impurities.
240: A certain monk named Tissa received a beautiful robe and was very happy. He prepared
  to wear them the next day, but that very night he died. Because he was too attached
  to the robe, he was born as an insect in it. The monks decided to share his former
  robe amongst themselves. The insect was very angry and shouted, "They are destroying
  my robe!" The Buddha heard this and told the monks to leave the robe untouched for
  seven days. Later the insect died and was reborn in a happy state because of his
  former good deeds. The Buddha explained to the monks that if they were to use the
  robe while the insect was stile alive, he would feel hate and anger and would have
  to be born in miserable existence. The Buddha then told this verse, saying that
  the monks should not be attached to anything, especially not to their four requisites.
241: Venerable Sariputta and Maha Moggallana used to deliver discourses in the city
  of Savatthi. Many people praised them for speaking clearly and eloquently. There
  was a monk named Laludayi who remarked that if he were invited to speak, people
  would praise him even more. So people invited him to deliver a discourse. But when
  Laludayi got to the platform, he could not open his mouth. So he asked another monk
  to speak first and that he would speak next. This happened three times. People realized
  that he was just boasting and laughed at him and reprimanded him. Laludayi left
  in shame. When the Buddha learned about this incident, he spoke this verse, saying
  that Laludayi did not study much and what he did study, he already forgot.
242: A certain woman committed adultery. Her husband was very ashamed and he avoided
  his friends and the Buddha. But after some time he came to see the Buddha and told
  him about his trouble. The Buddha told him this verse (and the following one, DhP
  243), saying that all these taints originate from ignorance.
243: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous one (DhP
  242). All the other stains, such as wrong conduct etc. are derived from the main
  "impurity", ignorance. It is because we are ignorant of the true reality, that we
  commit these evil deeds. Therefore, only if we destroy our ignorance, can we truly
  be called "pure". Destruction of ignorance is the main goal of the Buddha's teaching.
  This is what is called Nirvana.
244: There was a monk named Cula Sari. He was a physician and he often went to see
  patients. Once he was returning from a patient and he met Venerable Sariputta. Cula
  Sari told him his patient gave him delicious food as a payment. He offered some
  food to Sariputta, who did not say anything and just continued on his way. Later
  Sariputta reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha told Cula Sari not to practice
  medicine for personal gain and told him this verse (and the following one, DhP 245).
245: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  244). One who is always trying to do good things, not to offend anyone, has indeed
  a difficult life. Always thinking about one's action, always mindful and reflecting
  on one's deeds, thoughts and words - these are just the basic requirements for such
  a way of life. On the other hand, if we just do not care about others, if we do
  not think about how our actions can cause suffering and pain, then the life is very
  easy. If we want to walk on the Buddha's path we should try our best to lead the
  difficult kind of life. After all, reflection and mindfulness are a part of meditation.
246: Not only monks stayed at the Jetavana monastery. Lay followers would also come
  to stay for a few days, observe precepts and meditate. Once five lay disciples observed
  one precept each. They all claimed that he was observing the most difficult precept.
  They argued for a long time and then reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha
  replied them with this verse (and the following ones, DhP 247 and DhP 248), saying
  that all the precepts are very difficult and all of them are equally important for
  a good life.
247: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  246) and the following one (DhP 248). To observe precepts and to lead a moral life
  is very difficult, but it is a basic step towards the Awakenment. That is why the
  Buddha says in this verse. If we do not follow them, we "dig out our own roots".
  That is to say, we postpone entering the way to Awakenment.
248: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous verses
  (DhP 246, DhP 247). As it is very difficult to observe the precepts and to lead
  a moral life, it is also very easy to break them. And it is also very easy to loose
  self-control. Once we lose it, it is extremely hard to get things back on track
  and to start our way towards Awakenment again. Therefore we will be suffering for
  a prolonged period of time.
249: There was a young novice named Tissa. He always criticized other people's good
  deeds. He even scolded famous donors like Anatha Pindika and Visakha. He also boasted
  that his parents were extremely rich and anybody could come to them and receive
  many precious gifts. Some monks decided to see if this was true. They went to Tissa's
  village only to find out that his parents were poor and that Tissa was only boasting.
  They returned and reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha reprimanded the
  young novice with this verse (and the following one, DhP 250).
250: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  249). Discontentment is one of the main roots of a disturbed mind. If we are not
  happy about what others do, how then can we attain a peace of mind? Discontent with
  what other monks receive as alms is only one such example. When we destroy such
  discontentment completely, then we are able to attain a peace of mind and therefore
  we can concentrate our minds and start on the way towards the Awakenment.
251: Once there were five lay followers listening to the Buddha's discourse. One of
  them was sleeping, the second one was scratching the ground with his hands, the
  third was shaking a tree and the fourth was looking up at the sky. But the fifth
  one listened carefully and respectfully. Ananda saw them and after the discourse
  was over he asked the Buddha about their behavior. The Buddha explained that the
  first one was a snake in his previous life therefore he liked to sleep. The second
  one was a subterranean animal, the third was a monkey and the fourth one was an
  astrologer. But the fifth one was a learned man; therefore he was able to listen
  with attention. Ananda then asked what things prevent people from listening and
  understanding the Dharma. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying it is passion,
  hatred, delusion and thirst.
252: In the town of Bhaddiya there lived a rich man named Mendaka. When the Buddha
  arrived at Bhaddiya, he realized that Mendaka and his whole family are able to understand
  the Dharma. He explained the teaching to them and after hearing the Dharma from
  him, Mendaka, his wife, son, daughter-in-law and servant all attained the first
  level of Awakenment. Mendaka related how many ascetic teachers spoke ill of the
  Buddha and tried to dissuade Mendaka from seeing the Buddha. The Buddha explained
  by this verse, that it is only very natural to see others' faults and not to see
  one's own. The Buddha then revealed the past existences of Mendaka. He was always
  a rich man who donated many things to those seeking Awakenment.
253: There was a monk named Ujjhana Sabbi. He was always finding faults with others,
  very easy to get angry and speaking ill of people. When the Buddha found out, he
  spoke this verse. He also added that sometimes finding faults with others is good.
  When we see somebody to misbehave and we try to teach him good ways - that is worthy
  of praise. But if we do it out of spite and malice, then we won't be able to achieve
  concentration and therefore we get further and further away from the Awakenment.
254: The Buddha passed away in the town of Kusinara. At that time the ascetic named
  Subhadda stayed at Kusinara. He went to many religious teachers but none could satisfy
  his doubts and Subhadda did not become their pupil. Just before the Buddha died,
  Subhadda approached him and asked him some questions. The Buddha answered them in
  this verse (and the following one, DhP 255). Subhadda became a monk and later attained
  the Awakenment. He was the last direct pupil of the Buddha.
255: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  254). The Buddhas, Awakened Ones have no "shaking". The meaning of this is that
  there is no instability, no wavering or unsteadiness of their minds. They have reached
  the highest Awakenment and their minds are truly firm and steady.
256: Some monks were returning from Savatthi after their almsround. Because there
  was a heavy rain, they took a shelter in a hall of justice. While there, they observed
  the judges deciding the cases very quickly after having taken bribes. The monks
  later reported the matter to the Buddha who told them this verse (and the following
  one, DhP 257).
257: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  257). It is very easy to judge others, to point out others' mistakes or bad qualities.
  Therefore we have to be very thorough when we have to judge others. We have to listen
  to every possible point of view; we have to look at the problem from all angles.
  Only then can we be able to judge according to truth and we can call ourselves "righteous".
258: A group of monks always caused troubles in the monastery. Wherever they went,
  some problems occurred. Once they boasted in front of some novices, saying only
  they were wise and intelligent. When the Buddha heard about this, he replied with
  this verse, saying that one should not be called wise only because one talks a lot.
  Only one who is peaceful and free from hate can be called wise.
259: A monk named Ekudana lived alone in the forest. He knew by heart only one verse
  of the Dharma, but he fully understood its meaning. Whenever he would recite the
  verse, the guardian spirits of the forest would applaud. At one occasion, two learned
  monks with many disciples came to that place. They asked Ekudana of there were many
  beings that wished to learn the Dharma. Ekudana told them about the spirits applauding
  every time the Dharma was spoken. The two monks they took turns preaching the Dharma
  but when they finished, the guardian spirits did not applaud at all. Therefore they
  started to doubt Ekudana’s words. But Ekudana simply recited the verse he knew and
  immediately the spirits started to applaud. The two monks returned to Savatthi and
  reported the matter to Buddha. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that in
  understanding the Dharma, quality is much more important than quantity. To remember
  only one verse, but understanding it fully is far better than remembering all the
  Buddha’s words but not actually grasping their meaning.
260: A group of monks came to see the Buddha. Because he knew they were very close
  to attaining the Awakenment, he asked them if they had seen an Elder just entering
  the room. The monks replied they did not see an Elder, only a young novice. The
  Buddha replied that this monk was actually not a novice, but an Elder. He further
  told them this verse (and the following one, DhP 261). The monks all attained the
  Arahantship.
261: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  260). Wisdom cannot be measured by age. One who is old is not necessarily wise.
  Sometimes a young person can be far wiser than somebody old. To grow old is not
  a virtue demanding automatic respect. We should save our respect for those who deserve
  it. People, who understand the Buddha's teaching deeply, and act accordingly, are
  to be respected, be they young or old.
262: The elder monks usually had some young novices as their students. It was custom
  that these novices would attend on their teachers, wash their robes, get water for
  them to drink and other small services. Some monks who had no students started to
  envy these elders. So they suggested to the Buddha that the novices should have
  more teachers to receive more guidance. Of course, the Buddha knew their real motive
  (to get some work done by the novices) so he refused this. He further admonished
  the monks by this verse (and the following one, DhP 263).
263: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  262). One, who wants to be respected, should discard all the impurities and clean
  one's mind. It is not possible to be envious, hating and selfish and expect others
  to respect us. To try to hide it away under the mask of nice words and smiling face
  maybe can fool somebody, but only for a short while. Then everybody will see the
  true face and their respect for us will quickly evaporate.
264: There was a monk named Hatthaka. He liked to argue with others. If he was defeated
  in an argument, he challenged his opponent to meet again at a specified place and
  time. Hatthaka would get to the place before the appointed time and would declare
  that the absence of his opponent means he acknowledges his defeat. Therefore he
  would boast he won the argument. When the Buddha heard about this, he admonished
  Hatthaka by this verse (and the following one, DhP 265).
265: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  264). To be a monk is not easy. Just to wear the monk's robe and have one's head
  shaven is certainly not enough. If a monk lacks discipline and resolve, then he
  is not to be called a monk. Only after having met and conquered evils, greed, desire
  and others, and with firm self-discipline, is one truly a monk.
266: There was a brahmin, who had the habit of going on almsround begging for almsfood,
  just as the Buddha's monks did. Therefore, he thought he was also to be called a
  monk. He went to see the Buddha and told him this idea. The Buddha reprimanded him
  with this verse (and the following one, DhP 267).
267: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  266). A true monk is not the one who wears monk's robes and gets his almsfood from
  people, but his heart is full of worldly things. Only one, who leads a moral life
  and has a deep insight into the reality of things, can be called a monk.
268: At the Buddha's times there were many ascetic orders. Some of them went for almsfood
  just like the Buddha's monks. After being offered food, some of them would say a
  few words of blessing; such as "May you be well and happy, may you live long." The
  Buddha's monks were at first instructed to keep silent. Some followers of the Buddha
  began to complain about that and wanted to hear some blessing also from the Buddha's
  monks. The Buddha then instructed his monks to do so, in order to keep lay followers
  happy. Then some other ascetics, who kept silence after being offered food, said
  that the Buddha's monks were not true sages (muni) because they did not keep the
  vow of silence in public (mona). The Buddha reacted with this verse (and the following
  one, DhP 269).
269: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  268). Silence does not necessarily mean wisdom. Sometimes one can keep silent only
  because one has nothing to say, or out of stupidity and not understanding what is
  going on. One who understands the reality of this world and the next one, who does
  not cling to anything and has discarded evil, can be truly called a sage.
270: There was a fisherman named Ariya living in Savatthi. Once while he was fishing,
  the Buddha and some monks went around. Ariya got up and paid his respects to the
  Buddha, who asked him about his name. When replied, the Buddha spoke this verse,
  saying that he was not worthy to be called Ariya ("Noble") if he harmed living beings.
  Ariya understood and attained the first level of Awakenment.
271: There were many monks who were practicing the Dharma. Not all of them had reached
  the Awakenment quickly. Once a group of monks came to see the Buddha. Some of them
  had observed the rules perfectly and were very virtuous. Others studied a lot of
  the Buddha's discourses and yet others were good in meditation. The Buddha asked
  them if they had attained the Awakenment. They replied that they did not but that
  it should be easy, since they had achieved so much already. The Buddha replied with
  this verse (and the following one, DhP 272).
272: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  271). To attain the Awakenment is not easy. We should not compare it to other tasks.
  Even if we have attained some spiritual progress, like good concentration of mind,
  if we have learned a lot of Sutras, or if we are truly moral and spiritual people
  - in comparison with the ultimate goal these tasks are very easy indeed. Only when
  we have reached the final goal and eradicated all the taints from our minds, then
  we can finally be content and say that we have done what had to be done.
273: Once the Buddha with a group of monks returned to the Jetavana monastery after
  a teaching trip. In the evening, some monks talked about the trip, about the condition
  of the path, about the nature of the land, whether it was hilly or flat etc. The
  Buddha entered the hall where they were talking and told them this verse (and the
  following ones, DhP 274, DhP 275 and DhP 276), saying that such talks were ultimately
  meaningless.
274: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  273) and the following ones (DhP 275 and DhP 276). The Eightfold path is said to
  be the only way to reach the Awakenment. It means, we have to follow all the eight
  constituents of the Path in order to be able to purify the mind and attain the Nirvana.
  What are the eight constituents of the Eightfold path? They are Right View, Right
  Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness
  and Right Concentration.
275: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP
  273, DhP 274) and the following one (DhP 276). The Buddha taught the teaching that
  he personally discovered. He taught from his own experience. He found out how to
  "remove the arrow", or how to end the suffering. He then proclaimed this path for
  everyone to follow. By doing so, we are able to do what the Buddha did - to put
  an end to suffering forever.
276: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP
  273, DhP 274 and DhP 275). The Buddha found the way to make an end to suffering.
  He taught it to us. But we have to make the effort. Nobody will do it for us. We
  cannot wait for a teacher to pull us from the swamp by some miracle. Only by diligent
  meditation and daily practice can we be released from the bond of Mara, from the
  world of suffering.
277: Once a group of monks obtained a subject of meditation from the Buddha. They
  went to the forest and practiced meditation. However, they made a little progress.
  Therefore they returned to the Buddha and asked him for another subject of meditation.
  The Buddha reflected that due to their past lives they were ready to perceive the
  impermanence of things. He told them this verse and advised them to meditate on
  its meaning.
278: Once a group of monks obtained a subject of meditation from the Buddha. They
  went to the forest and practiced meditation. However, they made a little progress.
  Therefore they returned to the Buddha and asked him for another subject of meditation.
  The Buddha reflected that due to their past lives they were ready to perceive the
  unsatisfactoriness of conditioned things. He told them this verse and advised them
  to meditate on its meaning.
279: Once a group of monks obtained a subject of meditation from the Buddha. They
  went to the forest and practiced meditation. However, they made a little progress.
  Therefore they returned to the Buddha and asked him for another subject of meditation.
  The Buddha reflected that due to their past lives they were ready to perceive that
  all things are without a self. He told them this verse and advised them to meditate
  on its meaning.
280: A group of young men became monks. They all received a subject of meditation
  from the Buddha and went to the forest to practice meditation. But one of them,
  named Tissa, stayed behind in the monastery and did not meditate diligently. The
  monks who practiced meditation all attained Awakenment and came back to the monastery
  to pay their respects to the Buddha. When Tissa saw that all of his friends were
  now Arahants, he regretted that he wasted his time. He decided to try very hard
  and started to meditate throughout the night. While he was practicing walking meditation
  he slipped and broke his leg. When the Buddha heard about this he spoke this verse,
  saying that we should exert while we can.
281: Venerable Moggallana once went on an alms-round with Venerable Lakkhana. Suddenly
  Moggallana smiled, because he saw a hungry ghost (peta) with the head of a pig and
  a human body. Later Lakkhana asked Moggallana why he smiled. Moggallana told him
  about the peta. The Buddha overheard that and told them that he himself saw the
  same peta. He then related the peta's story. Once he was a famous monk who was very
  good at expounding the Dharma. Once he came to a monastery, where two friend monks
  stayed. After a while he realized that he liked the place very much. There was plenty
  of good food and the lay followers liked his way of expounding the Dharma. So he
  decided to make the two monks go away and keep the place just for himself. He set
  one friend against the other. They quarreled and left away. Because of this the
  monk suffered for a long time. He had to be born as a hungry ghost. The Buddha finished
  his story by this verse, saying that we should always guard our actions bodily,
  verbal and mental.
282: There was a monk name Pothila. He knew the Dharma very well and taught it to
  many followers. But he did not practice meditation and was conceited. The Buddha
  wanted to put him on the right path and therefore called him "useless Pothila".
  Pothila reflected on those words and realized what did the Buddha mean. So he went
  to the senior monk and humbly asked to be his pupil. But the monk sent him to the
  next senior monk. This happened several times until Pothila ended up as a pupil
  of a young novice (who was an Arahant). He followed the meditation instructions
  diligently and was no longer conceited because of his theoretical mastery of the
  Dharma. The Buddha saw his effort and told him this verse. Soon after, Pothila reached
  the Awakenment.
283: In the city of Savatthi there lived five friends. When they became old, they
  all went forth and became monks. But they had the habit of going to their old homes
  for almsfood. Especially a former wife of one of them was a very good cook. So they
  went to her house often and she looked after them. But one day, this old lady fell
  sick and died. The five friends wept and lamented, praising her virtues. The Buddha
  overheard this and told them this verse (and the following one, DhP 284), saying
  that sorrow comes from ignorance, greed and hatred. Especially in this case, greed
  was the main factor. So he taught them to cut off "the forest" of greed and passions
  in order to be free from sorrow.
284: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  283). Greed or passion is one of the three main roots of evil. Due to the underlying
  ignorance, we feel passion and hatred, like and dislike. Because of that we do things
  with the mind bound with passion or hatred. Therefore we create karma that keeps
  us in the circle of life and death. Only when we cut off these passions and dissolve
  ignorance, can we stop creating karmically good and bad deeds and be free from suffering,
  with a free mind.
285: Venerable Sariputta had a young monk as a pupil. This monk was a son of a goldsmith.
  Sariputta gave him a subject of meditation (impurity of the body) and the monk went
  to the forest to practice meditation. But he did not make any progress and kept
  returning to Sariputta to ask for more instructions. So Sariputta took him to see
  the Buddha. The Buddha changed the tactics. He gave the monk a beautiful lotus.
  He told him to put it in front of himself and meditate on its purity and beauty.
  The monk did so and was able to reach unbroken concentration and achieve the fourth
  level of mental absorption (jhana). At that moment the Buddha made the lotus to
  wither. The monk saw this and realized the impermanence of all things. The Buddha
  then further exhorted him with this verse. The monk reflected on its meaning and
  attained the Awakenment.
286: Mahadhana was a merchant from Benares. Once he came to Savatthi during a festival,
  hoping to sell his goods. But on the way he was stopped by a flood and could not
  cross the river for seven days. Thus the festival ended before he even got there.
  Mahadhana decided to stay in Savatthi for some time and sell his goods slowly. Once
  the Buddha saw him and smiled. Ananda asked him about the reason for his smile.
  The Buddha replied that Mahadhana is not aware of his impeding death and thinks
  he can stay in Savatthi comfortably, sell his goods and then return home. Ananda
  then advised Mahadhana to listen to the Buddha's sermons and to practice mindfulness.
  Mahadhana was alarmed when he heard that he was about to die. For seven days he
  gave alms to the Buddha and monks and listened to the Dharma. After hearing this
  verse from the Buddha, he attained the first stage of Awakenment. After he died
  he was reborn in the Tusita heaven.
287: Kisa Gotami came to see the Buddha after her only son died. The Buddha told her
  this verse in order to calm her down. See DhP 114 for the whole story.
288: Patacara lost her husband, two sons, parents and the only brother almost at the
  same time. She grieved so much that she went almost crazy. When she came to see
  the Buddha, he told her this verse (and the following one, DhP 289) to calm her
  down. For the whole story see DhP 113.
289: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  288). The only help and protection against the death is constant and intensive practice
  of the Buddha’s teaching. No external help from relatives, friends or gods of any
  kind is possible when we have to face the death. Only by following the path of meditation
  and awareness, can we overcome death and face it without any fear.
290: Once there was a serious drought in Vesali. It was followed by a famine and an
  epidemic of diseases. People of Vesali tried many ways to ease this situation but
  nothing seemed to work. Finally, they sent messengers to the Buddha, asking him
  to go to Vesali. The Buddha accepted. As soon as he with a large group of monks
  reached Vesali there was a heavy rainfall, which cleaned the city. The Buddha recited
  a text called Ratana Sutta and instructed the monks to go around the city and recite
  the same text for seven days. After seven days, everything in Vesali returned to
  normal. People of the city were very grateful to the Buddha and since that day,
  the Buddha had a large group of followers in Vesali. The Ratana Sutta is used for
  protection even today.
291: Once there lived a woman who kept a hen. The hen would lay one egg every day
  and the woman would break it and eat it. The hen was very angry because of that
  and started hating the woman. As a result of his, they were always reborn together
  causing pain to each other. During the time of the Buddha, one of them was born
  as a woman and the other one as an ogress. Once the woman with her husband and son
  were on their way home from a visit to relatives. Her husband went to take a bath
  and she rested with her son by the roadside. At that moment, the ogress appeared
  and attacked her. The woman took her son and ran to the monastery for refuge. There
  the Buddha told them the whole story and asked them to stop hating each other, for
  otherwise they would never be free. He told them this verse to make them understand
  his meaning. Both of them realized the futility of hatred and agreed not to harm
  each other from then on.
292: 'In Bhaddiya there was a monastery with many monks. There was a sort of competition
  amongst these monks: who will make more beautiful ornamental slippers to wear. As
  a result of this, they neglected their meditation and they made no progress in spiritual
  matters. The matter was reported to the Buddha who admonished the monks from Bhaddiya.
  He told them this verse (and the following one, DhP 293). The monks realized the
  error of their ways and from that time on strove diligently to reach the Awakenment.'
293: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  292). These two verses are reminding us that we should not loose the vision of the
  final goal. If we spend most of our time trying to make "more and more beautiful
  slippers", then we have no time to practice in order to reach the goal. Only by
  diligently putting all of our effort into the practice, by staying mindful all of
  the time, can we hope to erase our taints and reach the Awakenment.
294: 'Once a group of monks visited the Buddha. While they were paying their respects,
  the monk Lakuntaka Bhaddiya, who was an Arahant, passed by. The Buddha told the
  monks this verse (and the following one, DhP 295). He told the monks to look at
  Lakuntaka Bhaddiya: he was a monk who has killed his parents, and kings, indeed
  the whole country; and yet he was walking calmly, without remorse. The monks could
  not understand what the Buddha was talking about! Surely this Arahant had killed
  nobody! Then the Buddha had to explain: "mother" means craving, "father" is conceit,
  "two warrior kings" are views of eternalism and nihilism, "the country" are sense-organs
  and sense-objects and the "followers" are attachment and lust.'
295: 'The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous one (DhP
  294). Here, the Brahmin kings are a simile for two extreme views. The "tiger as
  fifth" is taken to mean the five mental hindrances. These are: sense-desire (kamacchanda),
  ill-will (vyapada), sloth and torpor (thina-middha), restlessness and scruples (uddhacca-kukkucca)
  and skeptical doubt (vicikiccha).'
296: In the city of Rajagaha there lived a woodcutter. One day he took he and his
  son went to the forest to cut some wood. On the way back they stopped by a cemetery
  and ate their meal. While they were eating, their two oxen wandered away from them.
  When they realized this, the father went to search for the oxen and told the son
  to stay with the cart. The father found the oxen on the city but by that time the
  city gates were closed and he could not leave the city. The boy stayed outside by
  himself. He crawled under the cart and slept. At night, two spirits came and tried
  to frighten him. The boy cried, "I pay homage to the Buddha". The spirits immediately
  felt they had to protect the boy. One of them went to the palace of King Bimbisara
  and brought the king's food tray full of food. The boy ate and then slept until
  morning. The spirits left a message for the king written on the food tray (but only
  the king could read it). In the morning the king's servants started to look for
  the tray. Finally they found it with the boy. They thought he stole it therefore
  they took him to the king. The king found the note on the tray and realized that
  this case was not easy. The boy kept telling them his parents came to him in the
  sleep and fed him. The king then sent for his parents who said they slept at home.
  The king decided and took all of them to see the Buddha. The Buddha explained what
  happened. The king then asked if mindfulness directed to the Buddha is the only
  way to guard against danger. The Buddha further explained by six verses (this one
  and the following five, DhP 297 - DhP 301) that mindfulness in general is the way
  to guard against danger.
297: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  296) and the four following ones (DhP 298 - DhP 301). Recollection of the qualities
  of the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha is one of the most favorite meditation subjects
  in the meditation of insight (vipassana).
298: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP
  296, DhP 297) and the following ones (DhP 299 - DhP 301).
299: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP
  296, DhP 297 and DhP 298) and the following ones (DhP 300 and DhP 301). This is
  perhaps the most important and most usual form of meditation - mindfulness of the
  body. We are trying to be mindful of all bodily movements, of breath, of every posture
  and intentions to move. There is one whole text in the Pali Buddhist Canon (Satipatthana-sutta)
  dealing with this meditation.
300: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP
  296, DhP 297, DhP 298 and DhP 299) and the following one (DhP 301). Non-violence
  is also one very important factor in Buddhist meditation. Active non-violence is
  also called metta (loving-kindness). We should practice the meditation of loving-kindness
  at the end of every meditation session.
301: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP
  296 - DhP 300). The forms of meditation described in the previous five verses are
  the most important in Buddhist practice. By following all of them, by devoting our
  minds to meditation day and night, we can truly hope to achieve the Awakenment and
  be free from suffering.
302: Once there was a big festival in Vesali. The city was lit up and full of happy
  people, everybody was singing and dancing. A young monk in the monastery saw the
  festival from a distance and felt dissatisfied with his life as a monk. He complained
  aloud that he has the worst lot in the whole world. At that instant, a guardian
  spirit appeared and told the monk that as those in hells envy those in heaven, so
  do people from the city envy the monks in the forest. The monk realized the truth.
  In the morning he told this story to the Buddha, who admonished him with this verse,
  further adding that the monk should reflect on the impermanence and pain in the
  lives of all beings.
303: Venerable Sariputta had a lay disciple named Citta. Although he was not a monk
  he attained the third level of Awakenment. Once he came to Savatthi in order to
  pay his respects to the Buddha. He came with a caravan, many carts loaded with food
  and other goods. He stayed in the monastery many days, continually making offerings
  to the Buddha and monks. But still his goods did not diminish one bit. The day before
  he had to leave for his hometown, Citta offered all of his goods to the Community.
  But his carts were immediately full again! The gods filled them up with various
  priceless things. Venerable Ananda reported this to the Buddha. He replied with
  this verse, saying that somebody as Citta will be revered wherever he goes.
304: Anatha Pindika and Ugga both studied under the same teacher while they were young.
  Later Anatha Pindika had a daughter and Ugga had a son. When the children grew up,
  their parents arranged their marriage. The daughter of Anatha Pindika, named Cula
  Subhadda went to live with her husband and parents-in-law. Ugga and his family were
  not followers of the Buddha, but they were disciples of different ascetic school
  (called "naked ascetics", because the monks did not wear any clothes). Cula Subhadda
  told her mother-in-law about the Buddha and she was anxious to see him. She agreed
  to invite the Buddha for the almsfood the next day. Because the Jetavana monastery
  was far away, Cula Subhadda made the invitation only with her heart. But the Buddha
  knew and accepted the invitation. At that day, Anatha Pindika went to the monastery
  and invited the Buddha to have almsfood in his house the next day. But the Buddha
  replied that he had already accepted Cula Subhadda's invitation. Anatha Pindika
  asked how was it possible if his daughter lived so far away. The Buddha replied
  with this verse, saying that the good ones can be seen and heard from far away.
  The next day, the Buddha with many monks went to the house of Ugga. After the meal,
  he delivered a discourse. The whole Ugga's family became followers of the Buddha.
305: Venerable Ekavihari used to live alone, eat alone and meditating in solitude.
  He did not like to keep company of other monks. Some monks did not understand why
  he did so and reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha praised Ekavihari and
  spoke this verse about how good it is for a monk to concentrate on meditation in
  seclusion.
306: The Buddha had many followers. Some of them had been disciples of other teachers
  and came to the Buddha after hearing and realizing the Dharma. The other teachers
  did not much like this and some of them came up with a plan. They instructed a young
  woman named Sundari to make it appear as if she had an affair with the Buddha. In
  the evening, she would go in the direction of the monastery and in the morning return
  from that direction to the city. To anyone interested she would say that she is
  the Buddha's mistress. Then the plotters hired some killers to kill Sundari and
  dumped her body near the Buddha's monastery. The body was found and the plotters
  started to go around the city, saying that not only the Buddha had a mistress; he
  also killed her when the fact became known. The Buddha remained calm, he just replied
  with this verse. The king decided to investigate the matter further. Thus his men
  learned about the hired killers. When these were arrested, they admitted to being
  hired by the evil plotters. They were made to go around the city, proclaiming their
  own crime and the Buddha's complete innocence in the matter. The fame of the Buddha
  was much enhanced and he had even more followers than before.
307: Venerable Moggallana once saw a group of hungry spirits (peta). When he returned
  to the monastery, he asked the Buddha about the spirits. The Buddha said that these
  were monks a long time ago. But they did not pay any attention to their spiritual
  development and committed a lot of evil deeds. Because of that, they were suffering
  in hell for a long period of time and now were still reborn in a woeful state. The
  Buddha then added this verse, saying that if a monk does not take the monkshood
  seriously, he can expect bad results.
308: Once there was a famine. In order to have enough food, some monks pretended in
  front of lay followers that they have attained Arahantship. The lay followers offered
  them only the best food, leaving almost nothing for themselves. At the end of the
  Rain Retreat, the monks went to see the Buddha. Whereas all the other monks were
  pale and undernourished, this group was very healthy and fat. The Buddha asked them
  how that was possible. They told him what happened. The Buddha spoke this verse,
  saying that for a monk to pretend some level of attainment was one of the worst
  things to do.
309: The famous benefactor Anatha Pindika had a nephew named Khema. He was not only
  very rich, but also very handsome. Women fell attracted to him and Khema committed
  adultery often. He was caught several times, but the king did not take any actions
  against him, out of respect for his uncle. When Anatha Pindika found out, he took
  Khema to see the Buddha. The Buddha spoke this verse (and the following one, Dhp
  310) enumerating the bad results of adultery. Khema changed his behavior and observed
  the code of morality, the Five Precepts.
310: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  309).
311: There was a monk who once unintentionally cut of some plants. He felt very remorseful
  and confessed to another monk his offence. This second monk just laughed at him,
  saying that cutting of plants is only a very minor offence. To show, what he felt
  about it, this monk started to uproot plants around him. When the Buddha heard about
  this, he advised this monk by this verse (and two following one, DhP 312 and DhP
  313) not to think little of minor rules. Plants are also living beings and should
  not be destroyed without reason. At first, the monk was obstinate, but later he
  realized the importance of the monk's precepts. Thereafter he followed the moral
  code strictly and practiced the meditation diligently. Later he attained the Arahantship.
312: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  311) and the following one (DhP 313). Again, we are reminded, that the life of a
  monk is not easy. We should not think it to be very undemanding. This life is very
  difficult and full of hardships. A monk must endure them all, without trying to
  bend the rules of monastic conduct. Only then will the monastic life bear the ultimate
  fruit - the attainment of Arahantship.
313: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous two verses
  (DhP 311, DhP 312). When one becomes a monk, it is because "there is something to
  be done". The task is - the complete liberation from the cycle of rebirths. All
  the energy should be applied to this task. If a monk is lax, there is no progress
  possible. The only result will be "heaping up" of more and more "dust" - hindrances
  and obstacles on the way to this final goal.
314: In Savatthi there lived a very jealous woman. She found out that her husband
  was having an affair with her maid. So one day she tied up the maid, cut off her
  ears and nose and locked her up in a room. Then she accompanied her husband to the
  Jetavana monastery. The relatives of the maid immediately found out what happened.
  They freed her and took her to see the Buddha. The maid told the whole congregation
  (where the woman with her husband were also present) what had happened. The Buddha
  admonished the woman with this verse, saying that it is better not to do any kind
  of evil, not even in secret - because everything will be known at the end. The woman
  realized her mistakes and strove to uproot her jealousy.
315: Some monks were staying at the border city. At the beginning the people of the
  city took good care of them and provided them with all the necessities. But later
  some bandits attacked the city, plundered it and took many citizens away. As a result,
  the city had to be rebuilt and the people did not have enough to look after the
  monks as much as before. After some time, the monks went to see the Buddha and told
  him the story. The Buddha told them they should not be greedy and be satisfied with
  a little. He further admonished them with this verse, saying that just like the
  citizens guarded their city, so a monk should be always on guard and practice earnestly.
316: A group of monks once saw some naked ascetics on their almsround. They were naked
  but they had their bowls covered with a piece of cloth. The monks remarked that
  perhaps they should put the cloth on the front part of the body. The naked ascetics
  retorted that they cover their bowls because they do not want insect and miniature
  life-form to enter the bowl and be killed by them later. The monks returned to the
  monastery and told the story to the Buddha. The Buddha reacted with this verse (and
  the following one, DhP 317), saying that one who is ashamed of what is not shameful,
  but not ashamed of a shameful thing, surely will undergo a bad rebirth.
317: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the preceding verse (DhP
  316). We should be ashamed and afraid of things that are truly bad. Causing suffering
  to others in any way is bad and we should be always ashamed and afraid of doing
  so. On the other hand, being afraid and ashamed of something that is not bad at
  all (as for example the naked ascetics from the story) will not help us in any way
  on the road to the Awakenment. Thus we will only accumulate demerit and suffer a
  bad rebirth in the next life.
318: All members of a certain family in Savatthi were followers of an ascetic. They
  did not want their children to mix with the Buddha's followers' children. They specifically
  forbade their children to go to the Jetavana monastery. But once all the children
  were playing in the vicinity of the monastery and got thirsty. They asked one of
  their friends, whose parents were followers of the Buddha, to go to the monastery
  and bring them some water. The boy went inside and paid his respects to the Buddha.
  He told him about his friends who were not allowed to enter. The Buddha invited
  the children in to have a drink and gave them a discourse. At the end, the children
  became his followers. When they came home, they told their parents what happened.
  The parents were very angry and accused their children of disloyalty. But the neighbors,
  who were the followers of the Buddha, were able to change their view gradually and
  before long the whole family converted to the Buddha's teaching. When the Buddha
  heard about this, he spoke this verse (and the following one, DhP 319).
319: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  318). In order to ascertain a good future existence, both in this life and in the
  next one, we must always understand and distinguish right from wrong, good from
  bad. We also must use our understanding and insight to be able to decide which is
  which. Without this understanding we might choose wrongly and believe the good to
  be bad and vice versa. In this way, our future existence will not be good.
320: The queen Magandiya, the wife of the king Udena of Kosambi hated the Buddha.
  When he came to Kosambi, she hired some villains who followed the Buddha and abused
  him. Venerable Ananda suggested that the Buddha should just leave Kosambi and go
  elsewhere, but the Buddha replied with this verse (and the following two, DhP 321
  and Dhp 322), saying that he will endure the abuse patiently.
321: 'The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  320) and the following one (DhP 322). A tamed elephant is very valuable: it is an
  important symbol of the king. The king is driven all around the city on a tamed
  elephant. The tamed elephant is the best of all elephants. In the same way, one
  who "tamed" oneself is always the best of people. From the self-control begins the
  way to the Awakenment. Therefore, to show constraint when being abused is a very
  good training for those aspiring to the highest goal.'
322: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous two verses
  (DhP 320 and DhP 321). People of all regions in all times always desired to own
  thoroughbred and tamed animals. In this verse we are told that someone who tamed
  himself is to be praised even more.
323: A group of monks once saw an elephant trainer trying to subdue an elephant. The
  trainer could not succeed in any way he tried. One monk used to be an elephant trainer
  himself so he explained to the trainer how he should proceed. The elephant was then
  tamed very quickly. When the monks returned to the monastery, they reported this
  story to the Buddha. The Buddha admonished the monk with this verse, saying that
  he should first tame himself. Only in this way will he be able to reach the Nirvana.
  Taming elephants will not help him one little bit in pursuing this goal.
324: 'In Savatthi there lived a rich Brahmin. When his wife died, he gave all his
  wealth to his sons. After that his sons did not care about him at all. He was left
  penniless and reduced to begging. He went to the Buddha and asked for advice. The
  Buddha told him to tell his story wherever there was a large gathering of people.
  So the Brahmin went to the meeting of all the Brahmins from Savatthi (where his
  sons were also present) and told his story. People in the crowd got very angry and
  his sons were embarrassed. From that time on, they took very good care of their
  father. The Brahmin was receiving four food-trays every day and he gave two of them
  to the Buddha in alms. After a time, the Buddha got invited to the house of the
  eldest son and there he spoke this verse: although Dhanapala was tied up in captivity,
  he still remembered his parents in the forest.'
325: The king Pasenadi of Kosala once went to see the Buddha just after finishing
  an opulent meal. As a result, he was feeling drowsy and sleepy, could not concentrate
  on the Buddha's words and almost fell asleep. He apologized to the Buddha and told
  him about his heavy meal. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that overeating
  creates discomfort. The king acted accordingly, ate less and became much healthier
  and more active.
326: Sanu was a young samanera (novice). Once he recited the teaching and at the end
  he made dedication of merit to his parents. A spirit, who had been his mother in
  a previous existence, heard that and shared his merit. As a result, she was much
  respected amongst other spirits and gods. But Sanu grew up and was dissatisfied
  with his life as a monk. He went to see his mother (in the present existence) and
  told her he decided to leave the Order. His mother tried to persuade him not to
  do so, but he was firm. The spirit also overheard this; possessed the young man's
  body so that he started rolling on the floor. People gathered and then spoke out
  about the advantages of the life of a monk. If Sanu were to disrobe, he would not
  reach the Awakenment. Then the spirit left. After this experience Sanu decided to
  continue in the quest for the ultimate goal. He went back to the monastery and was
  fully ordained as a bhikkhu (monk). The Buddha wanted to help him and so he spoke
  this verse, guiding Sanu to control his mind. Sanu reflected on the message and
  later attained the Arahantship. He even became a very famous and revered teacher.
327: There was an elephant that was very strong when young, but as he got old, he
  became weak. Once he went to a pond and got stuck in the mud. The king sent some
  elephant trainers to help him. They started to beat the battle-drums. When the elephant
  heard them, his spirit rose and he freed himself from the mud. When the Buddha heard
  about this, he spoke this verse, saying that just as the elephant pulled himself
  out of mud, so we must pull ourselves from the mud of defilements and suffering.
328: The monks in the city of Kosambi once quarreled about some trivial matter. This
  led to a terrible dispute. Even the Buddha was not able to appease the quarrelling
  monks. So the Buddha left them and went to the forest to stay alone. After some
  time the monks cooled down and they realized their mistake. Therefore they went
  to the forest to find the Buddha and ask for his forgiveness. The Buddha told them
  this verse (and the following two, DhP 329 and DhP 330) to emphasize the value of
  a true friendship.
329: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  328) and for the following verse (DhP 330). If one does not find a good and worthy
  friend, it is better to be alone than to associate with bad people. Good friends
  are very important, because they can teach and guide us and set a good example worthy
  of following.
330: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous verses
  (DhP 328 and DhP 329). Companionship with a fool is very stressful. We cannot change
  the fool's ways, because a fool is a fool and does not realize hi foolishness. We
  are even in danger of becoming fools ourselves, if we lose control and start to
  learn from the fool. Therefore it is far better to be alone and to concentrate solely
  on our mental development and on reaching the Awakenment.
331: The Buddha was once thinking about how so many people were ill-treated by evil
  rulers. He tried to think up some way to convince the kings to rule wisely. Mara
  then tried to entice the Buddha to become a king himself. But the Buddha replied
  him with this verse (and the two following ones, DhP 332 and DhP 333), saying that
  their teachings were quite different and it was impossible for Mara to influence
  him to become a king.
332: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  331) and the following one (DhP 333). Filial love towards one's parents is (or should
  be) one of the basic foundations of our society even now, not to speak of the Buddha's
  times, when it was actually a crime not to look after one's parents (see the story
  for the verse in DhP 324). In this verse, the Buddha says that being a monk and
  reaching the state of a true Brahmin (which equals attaining the Awakenment) is
  as important as to love one’s parents. Maybe even more important - if we are able
  to reach Awakenment while our parents are still alive, we can teach them and help
  them on their own way towards this goal.
333: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous verses
  (DhP 331 and DhP 332). Virtue is the first and the most important factor that we
  must firmly establish before we start on the way towards the Awakenment. Abstaining
  from evil can of course be seen as a part of a moral life, but special emphasis
  is being put on this, because it is the first basic part of morality. Then there
  is trust, confidence that the way is truly leading towards the goal, that the methods
  described by the Buddha really work. And then can we start cultivating our minds
  in meditation in order to attain wisdom and achieve the Awakenment.
334: A fisherman in Savatthi once caught a beautiful golden fish. But when the fish
  opened its mouth, horrible smell spread all around. The Buddha was asked why this
  was so. The fish had been a monk named Kapila long time ago. Kapila was very learned
  and famous. He taught the Dharma to many people. As a result of this he became very
  conceited and looked down on other monks. Whenever somebody would try to censure
  him, Kapila would just grow angry. Soon everybody avoided him and that made Kapila
  even angrier and he developed hatred for the monks and for the Dharma. As a result
  of his conceit and hatred, he had to suffer for a long time. Because he taught the
  Dharma to many, he had a beautiful golden body. But because he used his mouth to
  abuse the monks and the Dharma, his breath was stinky and foul. The Buddha then
  added this verse (and the three following ones, DhP 335, DhP 336 and DhP 337).
335: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  334) and the two following verses (DhP 336 and DhP 337). Thirst and craving are
  one of the main roots of evil, origins of suffering. The more we are in power of
  craving, the more suffering and sorrow will befall us. To cut off the craving in
  our minds is to destroy all sorrow and suffering.
336: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous verses
  (DhP 334 and DhP 335) and for the following verse (DhP 337). To defeat the thirst
  and craving is to defeat the suffering and sorrow. It equals the attainment of Awakenment.
  Only after reaching the goal of Arahantship, is the thirst completely eradicated
  and the mind is free from sorrow and suffering. In order to do that one must practice
  meditation diligently, as taught by the Buddha.
337: The fishermen in Savatthi once caught a beautiful golden fish. They took it to
  the king who in turn sent it to the Buddha. When the fish opened its mouth, horrible
  smell spread all around. When asked about this, the Buddha replied that this fish
  as a learned monk named Kapila a long time ago, during the times of the Buddha Kassapa.
  Kapila was learned, but very conceited. He did not stand any criticism from other
  monks, whom he looked down upon. As a result, the other monks started to avoid him.
  At one occasion, Kapila was delivering a discourse, but nobody went to attend. Kapila
  then started to think that Dharma had no meaning at all. Because of this, he was
  born as a fish with a foul breath. But because he taught the Dharma to many before
  he became so sour, he had a beautiful golden body. The Buddha then spoke this verse
  and went on to stress the importance of equally combining theoretical learning with
  meditation practice.
338: Once the Buddha saw a female pig and he smiled. Venerable Ananda asked him about
  the reason for his smile. The Buddha told him that this pig used to be a hen during
  the times pf the previous Buddha. The hen lived close to a monastery and as a result
  listened to the discourses. Later she was reborn as a princess. Once she noticed
  some worms in the toilet and started to meditate on the repulsiveness of the body.
  Later she was reborn as a Brahma type of deity. And now again, because of some demerit,
  she was born as a pig. The Buddha commented in this verse (and the five following
  ones, DhP 339 - DhP 343) how there was simply no end of the round of existences
  on account of good and bad karma.
339: 'The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  338) and for the four following verses (DhP 340 - DhP 343). The thirty-six streams
  in this verse are the three types of craving (for sensual pleasure, for eternal
  existence, for non-existence) in relation to each of six sense organs that the Buddhist
  psychology works with: eye, nose, ears, tongue, body and mind.'
340: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous verses
  (DhP 338 and DhP 339) and with the three following verses (DhP 341, DhP 342 and
  DhP 343). The streams in this verse are identical with the thirty-six streams from
  the previous verse (DhP 339). The creeper means passion. It has to be cut off completely
  with the wisdom gained in meditation practice in order to enable us to reach the
  Awakenment.
341: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the three previous verses
  (DhP 338, Dhp 339 and Dhp 340) and for the two following verses (DhP 342 and DhP
  343). Our senses bring in all kinds of data. We are attached to the pleasures coming
  from these senses. Because of that, we create positive and negative karma and this
  karma will come into fruition in the future as more births and deaths for us. The
  solution is to cut off the attachment to this pleasure and with equanimity concentrate
  on the highest goal, the Awakenment.
342: 'The story for this verse is identical with the one for the four previous verses
  (DhP 338, DhP 339, DhP 340 and DhP 341) and for the following verse (DhP 343). There
  are ten fetters (sajyojana). They can be divided into two kinds, five so called
  "lower" or "big" fetters and five "higher" or "small" fetters. The five big fetters
  are: 1) personality belief (sakkaya-ditthi), 2) skeptical doubt (vicikiccha), 3)
  clinging to rules and rituals (silabbata-paramasa), 4) sensuous craving (kama-raga),
  5) ill-will (vyapada). The five small fetters are: 1) craving for fine-material
  existence (rupa-raga), 2) craving for immaterial existence (arupa-raga), 3) conceit
  (mana), 4) restlessness (uddhacca), 5) ignorance (avijja).'
343: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the five previous verses
  (DhP 338, DhP 339, DhP 340, DhP 341 and DhP 342). Because of craving people "crawl
  around" from existence into existence. Just like a captured hare tries very hard
  to escape but the fetter is stronger, so it manages only to cut itself. People also
  try to be free but do it the wrong way, only falling more and more deeply into the
  snare of passions and repeated existence. The solution is to remove all the passion
  and thirst and escape the snare of Samsara forever.
344: A certain monk was a pupil of Venerable Maha Kassapa. Although he did not reach
  any stage of Awakenment, he was able to achieve the four mental absorptions (jhana).
  Once he visited his uncle who was a goldsmith and developed a strong craving for
  the gold ornaments he saw there. Therefore he left the Order and came to live with
  his uncle. But because he was lazy, his uncle threw him out of the house. The man
  became a thief. After some time he was caught and sentenced to execution. At the
  execution ground he did not show any fear at all and established himself in deep
  mental absorption. When the executioners saw that they were very surprised and informed
  the king. The king gave the order to release the man. The Buddha then admonished
  the monk with this verse, showing him how foolish it was to leave the monk's life.
  He further instructed the man in the meditation of insight. The man reached the
  first stage of Awakenment. Later he rejoined the Order and soon reached the Arahantship.
345: A group of monks once went to the city of Savatthi for almsfood. On their way
  they observed some prisoners being led with their hands and legs chained in bonds.
  When they returned to the monastery they related the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha
  spoke this verse (and the following one, DhP 346) and explained that passion and
  craving were much stronger fetters than all the chains and handcuffs.
346: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  345). All the man-made fetters like iron handcuffs, ropes and wooden bonds can not
  equal craving and longing for beautiful things and loved persons. Bond by these
  fetters, all beings crawl from existence to existence, unable to break free. Only
  through abandoning this craving can we be free from the fetters of Samsara.
347: Queen Khema was the wife of king Bimbisara. She was very beautiful and proud
  of her beauty. The king wanted her to go to the monastery and listen to the Buddha's
  discourse. But Khema knew that the Buddha often talked about impermanency and non-attachment
  to the body, she did not dare to go to see him. Finally the king ordered his musicians
  to play a song praising the Veluvana monastery and the queen decided to go. She
  sat in the audience while the Buddha was expounding the teaching. The Buddha then
  created a vision of a female form (which was visible only to Khema) to sit near
  him on the stage, where he was delivering his speech and to fan him. The girl was
  very young and extremely beautiful. Khema saw her and realized that compared to
  this girl she herself looked like a monkey. While she was looking, the girl began
  to grow older. She became a young woman, then a grown up woman, middle aged, old
  - and finally she became a very old woman. Khema realized that the change of the
  body is a continuing process and she found out that this beautiful young girl changed
  into an old ugly woman. Then the woman on stage, no longer able to control her body,
  was lying there, dying and finally she died. Her body got swollen and worms were
  all over it. Khema thus finally realized that also her beauty was very impermanent
  - it was subjected to illness, old age and death. The Buddha further instructed
  her with this verse and at the end Khema attained Arahantship. Later she joined
  the order and became the chief female disciple of the Buddha.
348: Once a group of wandering acrobats came to Rajagaha. A young man named Uggasena
  fell in love with a beautiful dancer from the troupe. He married her and joined
  the group. But since he was not an acrobat, he could only help carry boxes, drive
  carts and perform similar tasks. The girl gave birth to a son later but she often
  scolded her husband for not being able to do anything better. Uggasena therefore
  learned the secrets of acrobatics and became a very skilful acrobat himself. One
  day the group returned to Rajagaha. Uggasena was eager to perform as he expected
  to be applauded for his skills. Just as he was performing, the Buddha passed near
  the place and all the attention of the crowd was drawn to him. Uggasena just sat
  there feeling very depressed. The Buddha told him this verse and Uggasena reached
  the Awakenment there and then. He became a monk immediately. Later the Buddha told
  Uggasena's story. A long time ago, during the times of the Buddha Kassapa, Uggasena
  gave almsfood to a monk and made a wish that he could reach Arahantship one day.
  The monk was an Arahant and looked into the future and smiled, because he was able
  to see that his wish would be fulfilled. Uggasena misunderstood the monk's smile
  and thought the monk was laughing at him. Therefore he became angry. Because of
  that he had to travel with a group of acrobats for some time before reaching his
  goal.
349: A young monk once asked for some water in a house where a young woman lived alone.
  She fell in love with him immediately and invited him to come over for almsfood
  anytime he wanted. Later she would hint that she had enough money but felt very
  lonely. The monk felt himself attracted to her and began contemplating leaving the
  Order and marrying her. He became thin and nervous because of his thoughts and the
  matter was reported to the Buddha. The Buddha told the monk that in his previous
  life this woman was his wife. Once they were traveling and met some thieves. She
  fell in love with their leader and helped him kill her husband. Just like in the
  previous life she was the source of his death, so in this life she could well be
  the ruin of his life as a monk. The Buddha then spoke this verse (and the following
  one, DhP 350). The monk took the advice to his heart and began striving diligently
  towards the Awakenment.
350: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  349). The more we think about the pleasant things, the more we desire them. The
  thirst and attachment will grow. We should also reflect on the unpleasant and impure
  things in order to restrain our thirst and craving. In this way, we will be able
  to cut off the fetters that bind us to this world and we can reach the Awakenment.
351: A large group of monks came to visit the Jetavana monastery. The Buddha's son,
  novice Rahula had to sleep outside. Mara then took the form of an elephant and tried
  to scare Rahula. But Rahula did not show any trace of fear. The Buddha then came
  out and told Mara this verse (and the following one, DhP 352) telling him that Rahula
  was an Arahant and could not be scared by anything in the world. Mara realized he
  lost and disappeared.
352: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  351). At the time of the Buddha, the sacred texts of various religions were not
  supposed to be written down. It was considered a kind of sacrilege to do that. Writing
  was reserved only for worldly matters. Therefore it was crucial that the texts were
  always remembered correctly and without alteration, in order to protect the true
  words of the teacher without his disciples changing the meaning.
353: Just a short time after the Buddha had reached the Awakenment, he met a wandering
  ascetic named Upaka. Upaka was very impressed by the Buddha and asked him, who was
  his teacher. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying he did not have any teacher,
  but that he reached the Awakenment completely on his own. At the end Upaka said
  he did neither believed the Buddha nor disbelieved him and just walked away.
354: 'The gods were once arguing about four questions: Which is the best of all gifts?
  Which is the best among tastes? Which is the best of joys? How to conquer all suffering?
  They could not agree on an answer, so Sakka, the king of gods, went to see the Buddha
  and asked him these questions. The Buddha replied with this verse. Sakka then requested
  that he gods be invited to share the merit accumulated by the gift of Dharma. The
  Buddha agreed and from that time on it is a custom to invite the gods to partake
  of the merit whenever a good deed is done.'
355: King of Kosala came to see the Buddha once and told him that a rich old man died
  that day in Savatthi. He did not leave any heirs and so all his wealth was taken
  to the state treasury. He also related that the man was very stingy and did not
  give anything in charity. The Buddha then revealed that this man was also very rich
  in one of his past existences. Once he offered some almsfood to a monk but then
  in his stinginess regretted his deed. His brother who was also very rich had a son
  and this man killed the young boy in order to inherit all his brother's wealth.
  Because of that these deeds he suffered for a long time. In this present existence
  he did nothing to accumulate merit and therefore missed a good opportunity to do
  good with his wealth.
356: When the Buddha's mother died, she became a goddess named Santusita in the Tavatimsa
  heaven. When the Buddha attained the Awakenment, he went there to teach her the
  Dharma. While he was there, he also met two other gods. One of them, Indaka, was
  a man in his previous existence, who once offered a little almsfood to Venerable
  Anuruddha, the Buddha's disciple. The other god, Ankura, had given much almsfood
  in his lifetime as a human being, but none of the almsfood was to truly Awakened
  people. Ankura asked the Buddha how was it possible, that he had given so much and
  still was reborn in the same heaven as Indaka, who gave almsfood only once. The
  Buddha then replied with this verse (and three following ones, DhP 357, DhP 358
  and DhP 359), saying that quality is more important than quantity.
357: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  356) and the two following verses (DhP 358, DhP 359). Giving alms is very important,
  but we must also differentiate to whom we give. The gifts to those who are free
  of attachments bring much more fruit than what we give to someone who is enslaved
  by passion, hatred and ignorance.
358: The story for this verse is identical with the one for two previous verses (DhP
  356 and DhP 357) and for the following verse (DhP 359).
359: The story for this verse is identical with the one for three previous verses
  (DhP 356, DhP 357 and DhP 358). By these four verses the Buddha stresses the importance
  of giving alms to those who really deserve it. To give alms to those who are just
  lazy to work for their living will do harm to the society as well as to those people
  in question.
360: In Savatthi there were five monks who practiced restraint over just one of the
  senses. All of them claimed that they alone practiced the most important and difficult
  type of restraint. They quarreled for a long time and could not agree. Finally they
  went to ask the Buddha, who answered them with this verse (and the following one,
  DhP 361), saying that one must control all senses in order to reach the Awakenment.
361: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  360). Restraint over the six senses (in Buddhist psychology, the mind is counted
  as the sixths sense) is one of the basic requirements for really beneficial meditation
  practice. Without this control, the meditation cannot progress, because we will
  always be distracted from it by input from these very six senses. Therefore we must
  practice concentration and mindfulness in our daily lives and then apply this tool
  in our meditation practice.
362: There was a monk who was very skilled in throwing stones. Once he was sitting
  with his friends and they observed some geese flying over them. The monk boasted
  he could hit the eye of one of the geese. He took a pebble and threw it. The pebble
  hit the bird in the eye and the goose fell down dead. Other monks reported the incident
  to the Buddha who admonished the monk with this verse, telling him not to hurt any
  living beings and to strive for the Awakenment by the way of practicing restraint.
363: Venerable Sariputta and Venerable Moggallana were abused by a monk named Kokalika.
  As a result, suffering befell Kokalika. The other monks then remarked that he had
  to suffer because he could not control his tongue. The Buddha replied with this
  verse, saying that control over one's mouth is very important.
364: Close to the age of eighty years, the Buddha announced that he would attain the
  Parinibbana (pass away) very soon. The monks who had not attained the Awakenment
  yet, were very distressed and spent all the time with the Buddha, never leaving
  his presence. But there was a monk named Dhammarama who did not come to see the
  Buddha but kept to himself. Other monks thought he was disrespectful towards the
  teacher. But Dhammarama explained that in his opinion the highest homage to the
  Buddha would be if he could attain the Awakenment before the Buddha's passing away.
  The Buddha praised Dhammarama by this verse saying that a monk who really wants
  to pay homage to him should act as Dhammarama did.
365: Devadatta was the Buddha's cousin, He envied the Buddha his position and even
  though he himself was not an Arahant he tried to form his own separate school in
  opposition to the Buddha. Once a certain monk of the Buddha went to the Devadatta's
  monastery and appeared to be very friendly with the monks who lived there. He went
  there often, eating and enjoying that comfortable monastery. But still he claimed
  he did not become a follower of Devadatta. When the Buddha heard about this, he
  summoned the monk and told him this verse (and the following one, DhP 366) saying
  that he should not envy Devadatta's followers their comfort but should rather concentrate
  on his own meditation practice.
366: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  365). For a monk, material gains and comforts should not be important. A monk should
  disregard all the material gains and concentrate solely on spiritual gains. Material
  comfort can actually be a hindrance on the monk's path towards the Awakenment. Of
  course, this does not apply only to monks. All the Buddha's followers should view
  material wealth as not really important and spiritual wealth as the only really
  valuable thing.
367: In Savatthi lived a Brahmin and his wife who were followers of the Buddha. Often
  they offered almsfood to him and the monks. One day the Buddha came to their house
  to ask for some almsfood. The Brahmin was already eating and his wife was afraid
  that if her husband saw the Buddha he would offer all their food to him and she
  would have to cook again. So she went out and told the Buddha they had not food
  left that day. The Buddha knew they were both close to attaining the third stage
  of Awakenment, so he just shook his head and kept standing there. The wife could
  not help herself and started laughing. Her husband came out and immediately offered
  all their food to the Buddha. Then he asked how a monk should be judged, what makes
  a true monk. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that a true monk is not
  attached to anything in his body or his mind. Hearing this, the Brahmin and his
  wife attained the third stage of Awakenment (called anagami).
368: There was a rich lady living in a certain village. She had a son named Sona,
  who became a monk. Once he passed through his hometown on his way back to the Jetavana
  monastery. When his mother heard this, she organized a grand charity in his honor.
  She also erected a pavilion so that Sona could teach her and other villagers the
  Dharma. While they were at the pavilion listening to Sona's discourse, some thieves
  broke into the lady's house. Their leader went to the pavilion to make sure she
  did not return home earlier. The maid who was left behind came quickly telling her
  about the thieves. But the lady just said, "Let them take everything, I will not
  be disturbed while listening to the Dharma". The leader of the thieves got scared,
  returned to the house and told his companions to return all the stolen goods. Then
  they all went to the pavilion and listened to the Dharma. When the discourse was
  finished, they begged the lady for forgiveness. She forgave them and all the thieves
  became monks. They went to the forest and practiced meditation diligently. The Buddha
  told them this verse (and the eight following ones) to help them on their way to
  the Awakenment.
369: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  368) and for the seven following verses (DhP 370 - DhP 376). Our striving for the
  peace of mind, the Nirvana, is often compared with crossing a river. If our boat
  (our mind) is filled with water (passion and hatred) it is extremely hard or almost
  impossible to cross to the other shore. We have to empty the boat of our mind of
  water (consisting mainly but not only of passion and hatred) to be able to make
  it to the other shore of Nirvana quickly and safely.
370: 'The story for this verse is identical with the one for two previous verses (DhP
  368, DhP 369) and for the following six verses (DhP 371 - DhP 376). The five things
  to be cut off are the five "big" fetters: 1) personality belief (sakkaya-ditthi),
  2) skeptical doubt (vicikiccha), 3) clinging to rules and rituals (silabbata-paramasa),
  4) sensuous craving (kama-raga), 5) ill-will (vyapada). The five things to be abandoned
  are the five "small" fetters: 1) craving for fine-material existence (rupa-raga),
  2) craving for immaterial existence (arupa-raga), 3) conceit (mana), 4) restlessness
  (uddhacca), 5) ignorance (avijja). The five things to be cultivated are: 1) confidence
  (saddha), 2) mindfulness (sati), 3) effort (viriya), 4) concentration (samadhi),
  5) wisdom (pabba). The five attachments are: 1) passion (raga), 2) hatred (dosa),
  3) ignorance (moha), 4) pride (mana), 5) false views (ditthi).'
371: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the three previous verses
  (DhP 368 - DhP 370) and for the following five verses (DhP 372 - DhP 376). The five
  strands of sensual pleasures are all the pleasures, which can be enjoyed by any
  of the five senses. These pleasures are what most of the people strive for in this
  world and also in the next existence. For a follower of the Buddha they are obstacles
  on his path to the Awakenment and they are to be eradicated if we want to achieve
  any progress at all. The metal ball and burning refers to suffering that will surely
  follow the enjoyment of the sensual pleasures. Then it will be late to cry. Therefore
  we should diligently meditate and restrain our mind, so that it will not seek for
  the pleasures.
372: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the four previous verses
  (DhP 368 - DhP 371) and for the following four verses (DhP 373 - DhP376). Wisdom
  comes as a product of long and diligent meditation. There is no other way to obtain
  wisdom. On the other hand, one must possess an initial small portion of wisdom in
  order to understand the necessity of meditation. As a result, most people never
  start to meditate or if they do, they tire quickly and give up. Only one, who is
  wise and uses the wisdom in meditation in order to achieve even more wisdom, is
  able to reach the goal of Nirvana.
373: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the five previous verses
  (DhP 368 - DhP 372) and for the following three verses (DhP 374 - DhP 376). Staying
  in solitude is beneficial for monks who are practicing meditation so that they are
  cut off from all outside distractions. If a monk diligently meditates in solitude,
  his mind becomes tranquil and peaceful. Then he can gain a deep insight into the
  Dharma and realize the true nature of things. As a result, he experiences joy that
  is not felt by most people who are worldly oriented and their mind are in a whirlwind.
374: 'The story for this verse is identical with the one for the six previous verses
  (DhP 368 – DhP 373) and for the following two verses (DhP 375 and DhP 376). The
  five aggregates (khandha) are: rupa (form, body, matter), vedana (feeling), sabba
  (perception), savkhara (mental formations) and vibbana (consciousness). If we know
  truly and into last detail how these five aggregates come into being and how they
  disappear, we experience joy and happiness and know "the deathlessness" - in other
  words, the Nirvana.'
375: 'The story for this verse is identical with the one for seven previous verses
  (DhP 368 - DhP 374) and also for the following verse (DhP 376). As a tree needs
  its roots in order to be able to grow higher, so the life of a monk needs some basic
  roots in order to be able to reach the Nirvana. They are: guarding of one''s own
  senses (mind being the sixth sense), contentment with what one has and observing
  the 227 precepts of a monk, as given by the Buddha. If we nourish these roots diligently
  and for a long time, the tree of wisdom will grow higher and higher, fruiting in
  the attainment of Nirvana.'
376: The story for this verse is identical with the one for eight previous verses
  (DhP 368 - DhP 375). Friends are very important for a monk as well as for all other
  people. Good friends can set up a good example and can help on our way to the Awakenment.
  And of course, we can help them. Bad friends will only drag us down, towards bad
  habits and negligence.
377: A group of monks received a subject of meditation from the Buddha and they started
  to practice diligently. Once they observed a jasmine flowers, which blossomed beautifully
  in the morning, only to wither away and be shed in the evening. They realized that
  they must do the same with all the mental defilements of their minds. The Buddha
  then spoke this verse to them, further reinforcing the idea. The monks reflected
  on this and soon all attained the Awakenment.
378: A certain monk name Santakaya used to be a lion in his previous existence. He
  was very calm, moved only a little, he was very composed. Other monks reported this
  to the Buddha who told them about Santakaya's former existence and then further
  spoke this verse, saying that every monk should behave in this way - be calm and
  composed, like a lion.
379: There was a poor farmer named Nangala Kula. Once he was ploughing a field wearing
  his old clothes, when he saw a monk passing by. He asked to be ordained and became
  a monk on the spot. He left his plough and old clothes there and went to the monastery,
  which was not very far. After a time he would grow discontented with a life of a
  monk. In that case, he would go back to the tree, where he left his plough and clothes
  and would remind himself of his poor past. Thus his discontent left and he went
  back to his meditation practice. This happened several times. Other monks observed
  his visits to the tree and asked him what it meant. He replied that he had to go
  to his teacher. After some time he attained the Arahantship and stopped going to
  the tree. The monks asked him why he stopped. He told them that he did not need
  a teacher any longer. The monks asked the Buddha if that was so and the Buddha confirmed
  that Nangala Kula has indeed attained the Arahantship. The Buddha then added this
  verse (and the following one, DhP 380).
380: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  379). We are makers of our own destiny and we should not wait for any higher power
  to interfere in our lives and bring us happiness. By our actions, words and thoughts
  we every moment create our future. Therefore we must control our minds and tame
  it, just like if it was a horse. Only then our mind will "behave" and we will attain
  happiness.
381: In Savatthi there lived a young man named Vakkali. When he saw the Buddha for
  the first time he was very impressed with his calm and radiant appearance. He became
  a monk just to be close to the Buddha. As a result, he neglected his own spiritual
  development. The Buddha exhorted him that in order to see the Buddha, one must see
  the Dharma, his teaching. And he sent Vakkali away. Vakkali was very depressed and
  contemplated suicide. The Buddha understood his mind and sent forth his radiance
  to Vakkali’s presence. Vakkali felt as if the Buddha was really there, his mind
  calmed and he started to practice diligently. Soon he reached the Arahantship.
382: Venerable Anuruddha had a young pupil, a novice named Sumana. Although he was
  very young, he not only attained the Arahantship, but he was also endowed with supernatural
  powers. Once he brought a jar of water for his teacher from Anotatta Lake, which
  was extremely far away, by using his powers and flying to the lake. Once Anuruddha
  took Sumana to see the Buddha. Other novices laughed at Sumana because of his young
  age. So the Buddha announced that he wanted some novice to bring him water from
  Anotatta Lake. None of the novices was able to do so, except for Sumana, who flew
  to the lake as before. The Buddha then spoke this verse, saying that age does not
  matter if one practices the Dharma diligently.
383: A certain Brahmin in Savatthi was a follower of the Buddha. Often he invited
  the monks to his house and he would address them as Arahants. Those monks, who had
  not yet attained the Arahantship, were embarrassed and many monks started to avoid
  the Brahmin's house. The Brahmin felt sad and asked the Buddha why so many monks
  stopped coming to his house. The Buddha then questioned the monks and they told
  him about the Brahmin's form of address. The Buddha told them that the Brahmin did
  not mean anything bad; he spoke only out of his respect and devotion to the Arahants.
  Then the Buddha spoke this verse, saying that monks should uproot the stream of
  suffering, realize the destruction of conditioned things and experience the Nirvana.
384: A group of monks once came to see the Buddha. Venerable Sariputta perceived that
  those monks were very close to attaining the Arahantship. Therefore he approached
  the Buddha and asked him a question for the benefit of the monks. He asked, what
  were the two things that can bring about the disappearance of all bonds. The Buddha
  replied with this verse, adding that the two things were the tranquility and the
  insight meditations.
385: Mara once approached the Buddha and asked him what does the word para (the other
  shore) mean. The Buddha knew that it was Mara and replied with this verse, saying
  that the other shore is the Nirvana, which only the Arahants can reach.
386: Once a certain Brahmin thought that the Buddha always called his disciples "Brahmins"
  even though they were not Brahmins by caste. So he went to the Buddha and asked
  what he meant by "Brahmin". The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that one
  does not become a Brahmin by birth, but only by long and diligent practice of the
  Dharma.
387: The king Pasenadi once came to see the Buddha. He was dressed in royal clothes,
  with all the regalia. He was very resplendent. In the congregation sat Venerable
  Kaludayi, who was in deep meditation and his body was bright, as if emitting light.
  In the sky, the sun was setting and the moon was just rising, both of them radiating
  beautiful rays of light. Venerable Ananda observed all this and then he realized
  that the splendor of the Buddha is surpassing all others. He mentioned this and
  the Buddha replied with this verse, saying that the Buddha always shines by the
  power of morality, virtue, merit, wisdom and righteousness.
388: Once a certain ascetic came to see the Buddha and asked him, if he (the Brahmin)
  could also be called "a monk" (pabbajita). The Buddha replied with this verse, saying
  that in order to be called "a monk" one has to discard all evil and impurities of
  mind.
389: Venerable Sariputta was famous for his patience and forbearance. Once a certain
  Brahmin boasted he would provoke Sariputta to anger. He came to Sariputta while
  he was on his almsround and hit him on his back. Sariputta did not even turn around
  but calmly continued on his way. The Brahmin felt very ashamed and begged Sariputta
  for pardon. He then invited Sariputta to his house for almsfood. When the Buddha
  heard about this, he praised Sariputta with this verse (and the following one, DhP
  390).
390: The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP
  389). Whenever we are angry, but manage to turn away from the feelings of hatred
  and wish to hurt the opposite party, then we just won a small victory on the road
  towards the Awakenment and the appeasement of all suffering.
391: Pajapati Gotami was the Buddha's stepmother. When Maya, his own mother, died,
  Gotami raised the young prince Siddhattha, the future Buddha, herself. Later, when
  her husband, the Buddha's father, died, she became the first nun and established
  the Sangha of the nuns (bhikkhuni). Because she was the first nun, she was not ordained
  by the Sangha of the nuns, as was the rule. Therefore some nuns began to say that
  she was actually not nun at all and started to avoid her. When the Buddha heard
  about this, he told them that he himself gave Pajapati Gotami her ordination and
  therefore she was a properly ordained nun. He further said, that Pajapati Gotami
  was an Arahant and added this verse to praise her qualities.
392: 'Sariputta and Moggallana were friends ever since they were born. They grew up
  in one village, where their parents were Brahmins. Both youths searched for the
  teaching of Awakenment. They went to various teachers and performed various religious
  practices, but they were not satisfied. When they were at Rajagaha, the Buddha also
  came there together with his monks. One of them was Venerable Assaji, one of the
  first five disciples of the Buddha. Sariputta met Assaji while the later was on
  his almsround. Sariputta was impressed with Assaji''s calmness and serenity and
  asked him who was his teacher and what was his teaching. Assaji spoke a short verse:
  "The Tathagata (the Buddha) declared the cause and the cessation of all things that
  arise from a cause. This is what the Great Ascetic (The Buddha) says." Sariputta
  immediately attained the first level of Awakenment. He then went to inform Moggallana
  about this and told him the verse. Moggallana also attained the first stage of Awakenment.
  Together they went to see the Buddha and became monks. Soon they attained the Arahantship.
  Later they became the Buddha''s chief disciples. Venerable Sariputta always remembered
  that it was Assaji who taught him the Dharma and used to pay his respect in the
  direction, where his teacher was. The other monks misunderstood this and reported
  to the Buddha that Sariputta was still worshipping the directions as he had done
  before as a Brahmin. Sariputta then explained that he only honored his teacher.
  The Buddha then spoke this verse, saying that we should always honor the person,
  who taught us the Dharma in the first place.'
393: A certain Brahmin heard the Buddha to call his disciples "Brahmins". He asked
  the Buddha if they were truly Brahmins by birth. The Buddha replied that one ought
  not to be called "a Brahmin" because of birth, lineage or matted hair. Only someone
  who comprehends the truth and knows the Dharma can be called "a Brahmin".
394: There was a Brahmin, who climbed a tree near the city of Vesali. He hanged down
  from it and told the people to bring him gifts - otherwise the city will suffer.
  Ignorant people indeed brought him many gifts, because they were superstitious and
  feared the powers of the Brahmin. When the Buddha heard about it, he spoke this
  verse, saying that such "Brahmins" could fool only ignorant people.
395: Sakka, the king of gods, once came to pay homage to the Buddha, with many lesser
  gods in attendance. At the same time, Kisa Gotami, using her supernormal powers,
  flew to the Buddha also in order to pay homage to him. But when she saw Sakka with
  his entourage, she retreated. Sakka asked the Buddha who she was and the Buddha
  told him Kisa Gotami's story (see DhP 114 for the story). Then he spoke this verse,
  extolling virtues of meditation and ascetic livelihood.
396: A certain Brahmin once asked Buddha why he called his disciples "Brahmins". Was
  it then not proper that he should be called "a Brahmin" too, since he was born from
  Brahmin parents? The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that a true Brahmin
  is one who overcame all his attachments, not the one who was born from Brahmin parents.
397: 'Uggasena married a dancer and became an acrobat (see DhP 348 for the whole story).
  Once, while practicing on the long bamboo pole, he heard the Buddha''s teachings
  and attained the Arahantship. Then he became a monk. Later some monks questioned
  his attainment and asked the Buddha. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying
  that Uggasena was truly an Arahant, without any fetters. There are ten fetters (sajyojana).
  They can be divided into two kinds, five so called "lower" or "big" fetters and
  five "higher" or "small" fetters. The five big fetters are: 1) personality belief
  (sakkaya-ditthi), 2) skeptical doubt (vicikiccha), 3) clinging to rules and rituals
  (silabbata-paramasa), 4) sensuous craving (kama-raga), 5) ill-will (vyapada). The
  five small fetters are: 1) craving for fine-material existence (rupa-raga), 2) craving
  for immaterial existence (arupa-raga), 3) conceit (mana), 4) restlessness (uddhacca),
  5) ignorance (avijja).'
398: Two men from Savatthi owned oxen and they quarreled whose ox was stronger. So
  they filled a cart with sand and the two oxen tried to pull it. But the cart was
  so heavy that the oxen were able only to break the ropes and harnesses. The Buddha
  commented on the story with this verse, saying that we should cut the harnesses
  and fetters of our mind.
399: A certain Brahmin's wife was a follower of the Buddha and once she spoke the
  words in homage to the Buddha while her husband was entertaining some guests. He
  became very angry and decided to challenge the Buddha. He went to the monastery
  and asked the Buddha what do we have to kill in order to live peacefully and happily.
  The Buddha replied that we have to kill anger. The Brahmin immediately became a
  monk and later became an Arahant. When his brother heard about this, he became furious
  and went to the monastery in order to abuse the Buddha. Before he got a chance to
  speak, the Buddha asked him, "If you invite the guests for dinner but they don't
  eat anything at all - to whom does the food belong?" The Brahmin replied that the
  food was then his. The Buddha continued, "In the same way, I do not accept your
  abuse, so it will go back to you." The Brahmin also became a monk and later attained
  the Arahantship. Later also their two younger brothers came in anger to the Buddha,
  but also they were converted, became monks and later Arahants. The monks commented
  how great were the powers of the Buddha, that he was able not only to stop the Brahmins
  from abuse, but also made them to became monks and Arahants. The Buddha replied
  with this verse, saying that forbearance was the best weapon and power.
400: Venerable Sariputta and some monks went for almsfood in Nalaka village, where
  his family lived. His mother invited him and the monks into her house. But while
  she was serving them food, she was very rude to Sariputta and also to the rest of
  the monks, because she was not happy about him becoming a monk. But Sariputta borne
  the scolding patiently and without getting angry. Later the Buddha explained with
  this verse, that Arahants never loose their temper.
401: Once some monks were discussing the story of the Arahant nun Uppalavanna who
  was raped in the forest (see DhP 69). In this connection they asked the Buddha if
  Arahants enjoy sensual pleasures or do not. The Buddha replied with this verse,
  saying that the Arahants do not enjoy sensual pleasures, because the do not cling
  to anything at all.
402: A servant once escaped his master and became a monk, in due course reaching the
  Arahantship. Once when he was on an almsround with the Buddha, his former master
  saw him and tried grabbed him by his robe. But the Buddha explained that the man
  was not a servant any more, because he already escaped all kinds of enslavement
  by reaching the Arahantship.
403: The king of gods, Sakka came to pay homage to the Buddha once. At that time,
  the nun Khema came for the same purpose, using her supernormal powers, flying through
  the sky. But when she saw Sakka there, she left. Sakka asked the Buddha who this
  nun was. The Buddha described Khema with this verse, adding that she was foremost
  amongst the nuns as for wisdom.
404: A monk named Tissa lived in a cave practicing meditation. In the same cave there
  lived a spirit who found it difficult to live near somebody of such pure virtue,
  yet didn't dare to ask Tissa directly to leave. The spirit went to the nearby village
  and possessed a young boy. He then told the boy's mother that only after the boy
  is washed with water left over from washing Tissa's feet, would he leave the boy
  alone. The boy's mother asked Tissa for help and he agreed. The spirit then accused
  Tissa of exorcism (the practice of which is an offence for Buddhist monks) and on
  account of this asked him to leave. Tissa reflected on his acts and realized that
  he did not practice exorcism and had no offence. That gave him assurance and happiness
  and he attained the Arahantship in that very spot. Tissa continued to dwell in the
  cave for the whole Rain Retreat and when it was over, he went to see the Buddha.
  He narrated his encounter with the spirit and other monks asked the Buddha if Tissa
  was really an Arahant. The Buddha replied with this verse, confirming Tissa's attainment.
405: One monk went to the forest for meditation practice. He attained the Arahantship
  and went to the Buddha to offer his gratitude. On the way he passed through a certain
  village. There a wife quarreled with her husband and ran away. She followed close
  behind the monk. Her husband saw them and mistakenly thought that the monk is taking
  his wife away. So he beat the monk and took his wife back home. When the monk returned
  to the Jetavana monastery, he told his story. Other monks asked him if he was angry.
  He replied he was not, because he has no anger left in him. The Buddha then confirmed
  with this verse that the monk has indeed reached the Arahantship.
406: A Brahmin couple once prepared to offer food to the Buddhist monks. The wife
  sent her husband to the monastery to invite some senior monks. But the Buddha sent
  four novices (who were also Arahants). The wife was unhappy, did not offer the novices
  neither seats nor food and sent her husband back. He met Venerable Sariputta and
  brought him to their house. When Sariputta saw the situation, he returned to the
  monastery. The same thing happened next time, when the Brahmin brought Venerable
  Moggallana with him. Sakka, the king of the gods, then took a form of an old Brahmin
  and came to the house. Husband and wife paid their respects to him and offered him
  the seat of honor. Sakka refused and paid respects to the four novices. Then he
  revealed that he was Sakka and the novices were actually Arahants. The Brahmin couple
  fell very ashamed and immediately served the novices food. When the Buddha heard
  about this, he spoke this verse, saying that Arahants are not angry toward those,
  who are hostile.
407: Two brothers, Mahapanthaka and Culapanthaka became monks. But whereas Mahapanthaka
  soon became an Arahant, Culapanthaka was quite dull and could not make any progress.
  His brother then suggested that maybe it would be better for him to return to the
  lay life. The monks thought that he spoke out of anger and asked the Buddha if Arahants
  still have any anger left in them. The Buddha said that Mahapanthaka acted as he
  thought was the best for his brother - there was no anger at all. See also the story
  for gatha 25.
408: There was a monk named Pilinda Vaccha, who always addressed people in a offensive
  manner, as if he was somewhat superior. Other monks complained to the Buddha about
  it and he told them that Pilinda Vaccha had been born as a Brahmin for many past
  existences. Therefore, the way he addressed others was not meant as an offense (for
  Vaccha was an Arahant), but he did it simply out of force of habit. The Buddha then
  spoke this verse, saying that Arahants have no intention of harming others even
  with their speech.
409: A certain Brahmin once put his clothes beside his house, in order to air it.
  A monk who happened to pass by mistook it for a thrown away piece of cloth and he
  took it. The Brahmin accused him of stealing and the monk then returned the cloth
  back and went to the monastery. There he told the story to other monks. The monks
  started joking about this incident, asking him to describe the quality of the cloth.
  The monks only replied that he had no attachment to the clothes at all. The Buddha
  then confirmed that this monk was really an Arahant without attachment and added
  this verse, saying that Arahants do not take things not given to them.
410: Venerable Sariputta once spent a Rain Retreat at a certain village. The people
  there promised to give the monks all the requisites (robes etc.) at the end of the
  Retreat. However, when the Rains were over, not everything was received. So Sariputta
  told the monks to send the villagers over to him in case they brought the requisites.
  The monks misunderstood his intentions and told the Buddha that Sariputta still
  had attachments to worldly thing like robes. The Buddha explained that Sariputta's
  intention was to insure huge merit for the donors and enough of requisites for all
  the monks.
411: On one occasion, a similar thing that happened to Venerable Sariputta in the
  previous verse (see the commentary for gatha 410) happened to Venerable Moggallana.
  The Buddha then spoke this verse, saying that Moggallana was free of defilements.
412: One day the monks complained to the Buddha that a novice named Revata is getting
  many offerings from the people although he lives alone in the forest. They accused
  Revata of craving for material gains. The Buddha spoke this verse, saying that Revata
  has given up all cravings and is an Arahant.
413: There lived a Brahmin in Savatthi called Candabha. In one of his previous lives
  he made offerings to the stupa of the Buddha Kassapa. Because of this, a circle
  of light resembling the moon was radiating from his navel. Therefore he was called
  Candabha (moonlight). Some Brahmins took advantage of this and allowed people to
  touch Candabha for money. Once they passed the Jetavana monastery and laughed at
  some disciples of the Buddha who were on the way to hear the Dharma. Then they took
  Candabha inside to compete with the Buddha. When Candabha was in the presence of
  the Buddha, his ring of light went out. Candabha then asked the Buddha to tech him
  how to make such marks appear and disappear. The Buddha told him to join the Order.
  So Candabha became a monk and very soon he attained Arahantship and told his followers
  to go away, since he would no longer go with them around showing his navel. The
  Buddha then confirmed his attainment with this verse.
414: A princess named Suppavasa was pregnant for an unusually long time. She contemplated
  on the Three Jewels and then sent for the Buddha asking him for help. The Buddha
  recited, "May Suppavasa be free from danger, may she give birth to a healthy son."
  Just as these words were said, Suppavasa gave birth to a son. When he grew up, he
  became a monk named Sivali. Very quickly he attaind the Arahantship and was then
  famous for being able to receive offerings without difficulty. Once some monks asked
  why was his mother pregnant for such a long time. The Buddha said that in one of
  his previous life, Sivali was a prince who lost his kingdom and on an advice from
  his mother he besieged the city of his rival. As a result, the people of that city
  were hungry for several days. For this deed, Sivali and his mother had to suffer
  during the pregnancy and delivery.
415: In Savatthi there lived a rich family. They had a son named Sundara Samudda.
  He became a monk and lived in Rajagaha. His family missed him very much and they
  rented a courtesan to try to tempt him. She offered food to Sundara Samudda every
  day. Once she paid some children to play in the street and therefore she invited
  the monk inside her house, saying that it was too noisy and dusty outside. There
  she tried to tempt him to give up the life of a monk and become her husband. The
  monk got very alarmed and realized his mistake. But the Buddha was mindful of this
  struggle and sent forth his radiance and spoke this verse to Sundara Samudda. The
  monk attained the Arahantship.
416: 'This verse has two stories: 1) After the passing away of the previous Buddha
  (Kassapa) a monk went around for donations to build a stupa. He came to a house,
  where a goldsmith was quarreling with his wife. The man scolded him and sent him
  away. Later he realized the wrong he committed and donated gold flowers to the stupa.
  In the present life he was a son of a rich woman who had an illicit affair. When
  he was born, his mother put him away. A young woman adopted him and named him Jatila.
  When he grew up, he married a daughter of a merchant and later discovered a large
  amount of gold in his house (as a result of donating the golden flowers). He had
  children and later he became a monk. He soon attained the Arahantship. Later other
  monks asked him if he was still attached to his gold, to which he replied that he
  was not. The Buddha then spoke this verse, confirming Jatila''s Arahantship. 2)
  In Rajagaha there lived a rich man named Jotika. Once he presented the prince Ajatasattu
  with a great ruby. Ajatasattu, seeing the beauty of his palace and his wealth, vowed
  to take Jotika''s wealth away when he became a king. Later Ajatasattu killed his
  father and became a king. He tried to break into Jotika''s palace and loot it, but
  he was not successful. He went to ask the Buddha how that was possible, only to
  find Jotika sitting in the monastery and listening to the Buddha''s discourse. Jotika
  explained that his property couldn''t be taken from him against his wish. Later
  Jotika became a monk and attained the Arahantship. Other monks asked him if he still
  missed his mansion and he replied that he did not. The Buddha then spoke this verse,
  confirming Jotika''s Arahantship.'
417: A dancer named Nata Puttaka once became a monk and attained the Arahantship.
  One day he and other monks saw another dancer in the streets, practicing his art.
  They asked Nata Puttaka if he still missed dancing. He replied that he did not.
  The Buddha then spoke this verse, confirming Nata Puttaka's Arahantship.
418: The story for this verse as identical to the story for the previous one. See
  DhP 417.
419: In Rajagaha there lived a Brahmin Vavgisa who had a special knowledge. He would
  tap on the skull of a dead person and from that he could tell where that person
  had been reborn. Once he heard that the Buddha also could tell the person's next
  birth so he came to contest the Buddha. There were skulls of people reborn in hell,
  as animals, as human, as a god and the skull of an Arahant. Vavgisa knew all of
  them -- except the last one. He asked the Buddha if he could teach him this skill.
  The Buddha told him to become a monk and that he will teach him. As a monk, Vavgisa
  soon attained the Awakenment and did not need this skill any more -- and told his
  friends that he had reached the Arahantship. The Buddha confirmed his attainment
  with this verse.
420: The story for this verse as identical to the story for the previous one. See
  DhP 419.
421: A man named Visakha from Savatthi heard a discourse of the Buddha and attained
  the third stage of Awakenment. He asked his wife Dhammadinna for permission to become
  a monk. His wife did not accept his property, but instead decided to become a nun.
  Soon she attained the Arahantship. Once the former husband and wife met and discussed
  the Dharma. Dhammadinna would gladly discuss with him everything up to and including
  the third stage of Awakenment. But she would not talk about the full Arahantship,
  because, as she said, Visakha has not attained this yet. The Buddha then confirmed
  with this verse that Dhammadinna had attained the Awakenment.
422: The Kinf Pasenadi and Queen Mallika once gave alms to the Buddha and Community.
  The offering was done on a big scale. There was an elephant holding an umbrella
  over each monk. Because there were many monks, one untrained elephant had to be
  used. He held an umbrella over Venerable Avgulimala. Everybody was afraid that something
  would happen; however nothing did. Later, other monks asked Avgulimala if he was
  scared at that time. He replied that he was not, since he was an Arahant. The Buddha
  then confirmed Avgulimala's attainment with this verse.
423: The Buddha once suffered from some illness and asked a layman named Devahita
  for some water. Devahita was pleased and also sent some molasses. The Buddha had
  taken a bath and ate he molasses and felt better. Devahita then came to visit the
  Buddha to ask an offering made to whom gives more benefit. The Buddha replied with
  this verse, saying that the offering made to one who has given up all evil gives
  the most benefit.
