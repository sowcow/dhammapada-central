  The first word of the first sentence (manopubbaṅgammā) is a compound and forms an attribute to the subject of the sentence (the second word, dhammā). Compounds are very common in Indian languages, more so in Sanskrit, but to some extent also in Pali. The concept, which in English needs several words (preceded by mind) can be conveyed by only single word ("mind-preceded") in Pali. The whole compound is in nominative plural to agree with the subject.

  The subject (dhammā) is also in nominative plural. As the verb is "to be", it is again omitted.

  Next are two more attributes of the subject (manoseṭṭhā and manomayā). Again, they are both compounds ("mind-mastered" and "mind-produced") and they are also in nominative plural, as they have to agree with the subject. Here ends the first sentence of this verse.

  As we can see from the second sentence, the syntax is rather free. It is especially true in the poetry, although even the prose is syntactically much more free than in other languages.

  The subject is omitted in this sentence; it is the third person singular pronoun (he or she or generally "one"). The main verbs are bhāsati and karoti ("speaks" and "acts"). They are connected by two conjunctions vā (or) as is common in Pali -- in English we could use the pair "either-or". They are in the third person (denoting "one"), singular, present tense and indicative mood.

  The attributes to the verbs (manasā paduṭṭhena) are in the Instrumental case. This case expresses the instrument by which the action is done. It is an answer to the question "[By] whom?" "[By] what?". They must agree with each other in case and number.

  Note that the particle "ce" (if) occurs between two words of the attribute (manasā ce paduṭṭhena). Usually we would expect it at the end of the main sentence (manasā paduṭṭhena bhāsati vā karoti vā ce), but in the poetry this syntax is allowed.

  Next sentence is subordinated to the main sentence. It begins with and adverb (tato; thus, therefore) linking it to the previous sentence.

  The subject here is dukkha (suffering). It is in nominative singular. The main verb (anveti; follows) is in third person, singular, present tense and indicative mood.

  The object is naṃ (him; meaning the one who acts or speaks with a corrupted mind). It is in accusative case.

  Next is a clause cakkaṃ va vahato padaṃ (like the wheel the foot of the bearing animal). The verb is omitted (the verb anveti, follows, is implied from the previous sentence). The object padaṃ (foot) is in nominative case. Its attribute vahato (bearer's) is in genitive case. This case expresses a relation between two nouns. It can be translated by "of". It is an answer to the questions "Whose?".

  Cakkaṃ (wheel) is the object in this sentence. It is in accusative case.

  Again, we can note that the enclitic va (as, like) is placed just after the object. Usually we would expect this syntax: cakkaṃ vahato padaṃ va.
2: |-
  Most of this verse is identical with DhP 1. Please, see DhP 1 for the notes on the first four lines of this verse.

  We will talk about the last line, a clause chāyā va anapāyinī (like a never departing shadow). Chāyā (shadow) is in nominative case, because it is the subject of the sentence. The verb is omitted (again, the verb anveti is implied).

  We talked about the enclitic va (as, like) in DhP 1, therefore we will not mention it again here.

  The last word anapāyinī (never departing) is an attribute to the subject. It agrees with it in case -- it is in nominative.
3: |-
  The first sentence is actually a compound sentence containing four segments: 1) akkocchi maṃ, 2) avadhi maṃ, 3) ajini maṃ, 4) ahāsi me.

  We can deal with them as with separate sentences. In all four of them, the subject is omitted. Because all verbs are in 3rd person singular, aorist (one of the ways to express past tense in Pali), the subject is the 3rd person singular pronoun (he or she). As objects are used the pronouns "I" in accusative case in first three sentences and in genitive case in the last of them.

  Second sentence also contains two sentences: 1) ye ca taṃ upanayhanti, 2) veraṃ tesaṃ na sammati.

  In the first sentence, the object is ye (those, who) which is in nominative singular. The verb (upanayhanti) is in 3rd person plural, present tense, active voice and indicative mood. Object taṃ (that) is in accusative singular. The conjunction ca (and) should be placed at the end of the sentence (ye taṃ upanayhanti ca) but again, in the poetry these rules are not enforced rigidly.

  The second sentence has as the subject veraṃ (hatred), which is in nominative singular. The verb is sammati (is appeased; with the negative particle "na" - is not appeased). It is in 3rd person singular, present tense, active voice and indicative mood. The word tesaṃ (their) forms an attribute to the subject. It is in genitive plural.
4: |-
  The first sentence is discussed in the previous verse (DhP 3), therefore we will not repeat it here.

  In the second sentence there are only two changes compared with DhP 3. In the third line the verb upanayhanti ([they] harbour) has a negative particle "na" (not) thus changing the meaning of the verb to the negative ([they] do not harbour).

  In the fourth line, the negative particle is omitted -- the verb has a positive meaning now (and the verb is changed from sammati to upasammati).
5: |-
  The first line forms a separate sentence in this verse. The subject of the first sentence is verāni (hatred, note the plural form here) which is in nominative plural. The verb sammanti (are appeased) is negated by the negative particle "na" (not) which stands at the beginning of the sentence. The verb is in 3rd person plural, present tense, active voice and indicative mood. The word verena (by hatred, instrumental singular) is an attribute to the verb. There are two adverbs idha (here) and kudācanaṃ (ever; this is negated by the negative particle na). The sentence is stressed by the particle hi (indeed).

  In the second sentence (averena ca sammanti) subject is omitted (it is the word verāni from the previous line) and the verb is again sammanti. The word averena (by non-hatred) forms an attribute to the verb and it is in instrumental singular. The conjunction ca (and) connects this sentence to the previous one.

  The last sentence (esa dhammo sanantano) has as its subject the word esa (this, nominative singular). The verb is omitted, thus implying the verb "to be". The word dhammo (law, nominative singular) forms an attribute to the verb. This word has an attribute itself -- the word sanantano (eternal, nominative singular).
6: |-
  The first line consists of two sentences ("pare ca na vijānanti" and "mayaṃ ettha yamāmase"). In the first sentence the subject is pare (others, nominative plural) and the verb is vijānanti (understand; 3rd person, plural, active voice, indicative, present tense). The verb is negated by the negative particle na (not). The conjunction ca (and) connects this verse to the previous one (this chapter contains pairs of verses connected in meaning to each other).

  The second verse has as its subject the word mayaṃ (we, nominative plural). The verb is yamāmase (we should restrain [ourselves]), it is probably 3rd person, plural, optative (used for hypothetical action, for suggesting something. It can be translated by "should", "would" and "may"), medium voice (this voice was originally -- in Sanskrit -- used to express the action done for the oneself -- ie. in case one wants to say "I do for myself" one would use medium voice, in case of "I do for somebody else" the active voice would be used). The adverb ettha (here) is an attribute to the verb.

  The second line again brings two sentences ("ye ca tattha vijānanti" and "tato sammanti medhagā"). In the first one, the subject is ye (those, who, nominative plural) and the verb is vijānanti (understand, same as above). The conjunction ca (and) connects it to the previous line.

  In the second sentence, the subject is medhagā (quarrels, nominative plural) and the verb sammanti (are appeased, 3rd person, plural, active voice, indicative, present tense). The adverb tato (therefore) connects this sentence to the previous one.
7: |-
  The subject of this sentence is māro (Mara) in the last line. It is in nominative singular. The verb is pasahati (overcome) in 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense. The main object is the word taṃ (him, accusative singular). The first three lines form attributes to the object, namely: 1) subhānupassiṃ viharantaṃ, 2) indriyesu asaṃvutaṃ, 3) bhojanamhi cāmattaññuṃ, 4) kusītaṃ, 5) hīnavīriyaṃ. In the first attribute, both parts (subhānupassiṃ -- contemplating the pleasant and viharantaṃ -- living) are in accusative singular, as they must agree with the main object.

  The second attribute is asaṃvutaṃ (unrestrained) and therefore it is in accusative singular. The word indriyesu (in senses) forms an attribute to this word. It is in locative plural. Locative is the case, that expresses location. It is an answer to the question "Where?".

  The third attribute is amattaññuṃ (not knowing measure) which is in accusative singular. An attribute to this word is bhojanamhi (in food), which is in locative singular. There is also a conjunction ca (and) connecting this attribute to the other ones.

  The fourth attribute kusītaṃ (indolent) is in accusative singular.

  The last attribute hīnavīriyaṃ (of poor effort) is also in accusative singular.

  The particle ve (indeed) in the last line serves just as an affirmative particle.

  The second sentence (subordinate to the main sentence) is vāto rukkhaṃ va dubbalaṃ (as wind [overcomes] a weak tree). The subject of this sentence is vāto (wind) which is in nominative singular. The verb is omitted (implying here the verb pasahati from the main sentence). The object is rukkhaṃ (tree) and it is in accusative singular. The word dubbalaṃ (weak) forms an attribute to the object and it agrees with it in case and number. The enclitic va (as, like) connects this subordinate sentence to the main one.
8: 'This verse is in its structure similar to the previous one (see DhP 7) The subject
  stays the same (māro), verb pasahati is negated by the negative na (not). The object
  is also taṃ. The five attributes to the object also follow the same pattern, in
  first three cases they are just negated attributes from the previous verse: 1) asubhānupassiṃ
  viharantaṃ (instead of subhānupassiṃ viharantaṃ), 2) indriyesu susaṃvutaṃ (instead
  of indriyesu asaṃvutaṃ), 3) bhojanamhi ca mattaññuṃ (instead of bhojanamhi cāmattaññuṃ).
  Fourth and fifth attributes are saddhaṃ (trusting) and āraddhavīriyaṃ (firm in effort)
  respectively. They are both also in accusative singular. The subordinate sentence
  also has the same structure -- the subject stays vāto, the verb is again pasahati
  (here negated by na) from the main sentence and object is pabbataṃ (mountain, accusative
  singular). The word selaṃ (rocky) is an attribute to the object and it is also in
  accusative singular. Again, the enclitic va connects this clause to the main sentence.'
9: 'There are two related sentences in this verse. One is: anikkasāvo kāsāvaṃ yo vatthaṃ
  paridahissati apeto damasaccena and one is: na so kāsāvaṃ arahati. The syntax in
  the first sentence is rather atypical, although of course, in poetry the rules of
  syntax are not strictly followed. It should rather be: yo anikkasāvo apeto damasaccena
  kāsāvaṃ vatthaṃ paridahissati. The subject is yo (one, who), which is in nominative
  singular. The verb paridahissati (will wear) is in 3rd person, singular, future,
  active voice. The subject has two attributes. First is anikkasāvo (not rid of defilement),
  it agrees with the subject and is in nominative singular. Second one is apeto damasaccena
  (devoid of restraint and truth). Here apeto (devoid) is in nominative singular and
  damasaccena ("by" restraint and truth) is in instrumental singular, since it is
  actually an attribute to apeto. Second sentence is na so kāsāvaṃ arahati. Again,
  we would rather expect a bit different syntax, like: so kāsāvaṃ na arahati, but
  the deviation from "proper" syntax is not that big. The subject here is so (he)
  which is in nominative singular. The verb arahati (deserves, 3rd person, singular,
  active voice, indicative, present tense) is negated by the negative na (not). The
  word kāsāvaṃ is the object of this sentence, it is in accusative singular.'
10: |-
  As in the previous verse (DhP 9), here we also find two paratactic sentences: yo ca vantakasāvassa sīlesu susamāhito upeto damasaccena and sa ve kāsāvaṃ arahati.

  The subject in the first sentence is yo (one, who), which is in nominative singular. The verb assa (would be) is in 3rd person, singular, optative, active voice. Optative expresses an "option" of the verb. We can translate it by "would [verb]", "should [verb]" or "might [verb]".

  The subject has three attributes: vantakasāvo, sīlesu susamāhito and upeto damasaccena. First one is vantakasāvo (one, who has "thrown up" the defilement). It agrees with the subject and is therefore in nominative singular. Second one is the word susamāhito (well settled, agrees with the subject - it is in nominative singular) with its own attribute sīlesu (in virtues; locative plural). Last one is upeto damasaccena (endowed with restraint and truth). Here upeto (endowed) is in nominative singular and damasaccena (with restraint and truth) is in instrumental singular, since it is actually an attribute to upeto.

  In the second sentence, the subject is sa (he), which is in nominative singular. The verb arahati (deserves, 3rd person, singular, active voice, indicative, present tense) is stressed by the affirmative particle ve (indeed). The word kāsāvaṃ is the object of this sentence, it is in accusative singular.
11: |-
  The subject of this sentence is te (they). It is in nominative plural. Its corresponding verb is adhigacchanti (realize, discover), in 3rd person, plural, active, indicative and present tense. It is negated by the particle na (not). The object is sāraṃ (the essence), which is in accusative singular. The subject has three attributes: asāre sāramatino (thinking to be essential, what is not), sāre asāradassino (seeing no essence in what is essential) and micchāsaṅkappagocarā (feeding on wrong thoughts).

  The first of them is asāre sāramatino (thinking to be essential, what is not). The actual attribute here is sāramatino (thinking to be essential), which is in nominative plural to agree with the subject. The word asāre (in the non-essence) forms an attribute to the word sāramatino. It is in locative singular.

  Next one is sāre asāradassino (seeing no essence in what is essential). Again, the actual attribute is the word asāradassino (seeing no essence), which is in nominative plural. This word has itself an attribute, sāre (in the essence), which is in locative singular. The conjunction ca (and) connects this attribute to the previous one.

  Last of the attributes is micchāsaṅkappagocarā (feeding on wrong thoughts). It is a compound and it is in nominative plural, because it has to agree with the subject.
12: |-
  The subject of this sentence is te (they). It is in nominative plural. Its corresponding verb is adhigacchanti (realize, discover), in 3rd person, plural, active, indicative and present tense. The object is sāraṃ (the essence), which is in accusative singular. The subject has three attributes: sārañ ca sārato ñatvā (having known the essence as the essence), asārañ ca asārato (non-essential as non-essential) and sammāsaṅkappagocarā (feeding on right thoughts).

  First of them is sārañ ca sārato ñatvā (having known the essence as the essence). Here the verb is ñatvā (having known). It is in gerund, which is the way how to express the English "having done", "having gone" etc. The subject is omitted -it is the word te (they) from the second line (the main subject). Object is sāraṃ sārato (the essence as the essence), where sāraṃ is in accusative singular and sārato is and adverb. The conjunction ca (and) connects this attribute to the following one in a common style of Pali language (ca-ca).

  Next attribute is asārañ ca asārato (non-essential as non-essential). Here both the subject and verb are omitted. Of course, the subject is again te (they) and verb is ñatvā from the previous attribute. The word asārato is again an adverb. Asārañ (or asāraṃ without the euphonic combination) is in accusative singular. The word The conunction ca (and) forms the second part of the "ca-ca" pair mentioned in previous paragraph.

  Last of the attributes is sammāsaṅkappagocarā (feeding on right thoughts). It is a compound and it is in nominative plural, because it has to agree with the subject.
13: |-
  Two lines of this verse form two sentences, which are both parts of one compound sentence.

  First one is yathā agāraṃ ducchannaṃ vuṭṭhi samativijjhati (as a poorly covered house is penetrated by a rain). Here the subject is vuṭṭhi (rain, nominative singular). The verb is samativijjhati (penetrates, 3rd person singular, active, indicative, present tense). The object is agāraṃ (the house, accusative singular). This word has one attribute ducchannaṃ (poorly covered, accusative singular, it agrees with the main object). The relative clause yathā (like, as) connects this sentence to the following one (in a pattern yathā... - evaṃ...).

  The second part is evaṃ abhāvitaṃ cittaṃ rāgo samativijjhati (thus an undeveloped mind is penetrated by passion). The subject is rāgo (passion, nominative singular). The verb is samativijjhati (penetrates, 3rd person singular, active, indicative, present tense). The object is cittaṃ (the mind, accusative singular). This word has one attribute -- abhāvitaṃ (undeveloped, accusative singular, it agrees with the main object). The adverb evaṃ (thus) connects this sentence to the previous one.
14: |-
  Two lines of this verse form two sentences, which are both parts of one compound sentence.

  First one is yathā agāraṃ succhannaṃ vuṭṭhi na samativijjhati (as a well covered house is not penetrated by a rain). Here the subject is vuṭṭhi (rain, nominative singular). The verb is samativijjhati (penetrates, 3rd person singular, active, indicative, present tense, negated by the negative particle na -- not). The object is agāraṃ (the house, accusative singular). This word has one attribute succhannaṃ (well covered, accusative singular, it agrees with the main object). The relative clause yathā (like, as) connects this sentence to the following one (in a pattern yathā... - evaṃ...).

  The second part is evaṃ subhāvitaṃ cittaṃ rāgo na samativijjhati (thus a well developed mind is not penetrated by passion). The subject is rāgo (passion, nominative singular). The verb is samativijjhati (penetrates, 3rd person singular, active, indicative, present tense, negated by the negative particle na -- not). The object is cittaṃ (the mind, accusative singular). This word has one attribute -- subhāvitaṃ (well developed, accusative singular, it agrees with the main object). The adverb evaṃ (thus) connects this sentence to the previous one.
15: |-
  The first line consists of loosely connected sentences. They are:

  1) idha socati ([the wrongdoer] grieves here). Here the subject is omitted (it is the word pāpakārī from the third sentence). The verb socati (grieves) is in 3rd person singular, present tense, active voice, indicative. The adverb idha (here) is an attribute to the verb.

  2) pecca socati ([the wrongdoer] grieves after death). Again, the subject is the word pāpakārī from the following sentence. The verb is socati (as above). The gerund pecca (having gone) is an attribute to the verb.

  3) pāpakārī ubhayattha socati (the wrongdoer grieves in both states). The subject of this sentence (and of the two previous ones) is the word pāpakārī (wrongdoer). It is in nominative singular. The verb is socati (explained above). The adverb ubhayattha (in both places) serves as an attribute to the verb.

  The second line consists of two segments:

  1) so socati so vihaññati (he grieves, he is vexed). These two sentences are paratactic. They bot have the word so (he, nominative singular) as a subject and verbs socati (grieves, 3rd person singular, present tense, active voice, indicative) and vihaññati (is vexed, 3rd person singular, present tense, active voice, indicative) respectively.

  2) disvā kammakiliṭṭham attano (having seen his own evil deeds). This clause is subordinated to the previous one. It is introduced by the verb disvā (having seen, gerund). The word kammakiliṭṭham (evil deeds, accusative singular) forms an object. The word attano (one's own, genitive singular) is an attribute to the object.
16: |-
  The first line consists of loosely connected sentences. They are:

  1) idha modati ([the well-doer] rejoices here). Here the subject is omitted (it is the word katapuñño from the third sentence). The verb modati (rejoices) is in 3rd person singular, present tense, active voice, indicative. The adverb idha (here) is an attribute to the verb.

  2) pecca modati ([the well-doer] rejoices after death). Again, the subject is the word katapuñño from the following sentence. The verb is modati (as above). The gerund pecca (having gone) is an attribute to the verb.

  3) katapuñño ubhayattha modati (the well-doer rejoices in both states). The subject of this sentence (and of the two previous ones) is the word katapuñño (well-doer). It is in nominative singular. The verb is modati (explained above). The adverb ubhayattha (in both places) serves as an attribute to the verb.

  The second line consists of two segments:

  1) so modati so pamodati (he rejoices, he is happy). These two sentences are paratactic. They bot have the word so (he, nominative singular) as a subject and verbs modati (rejoices, 3rd person singular, present tense, active voice, indicative) and pamodati (is happy, 3rd person singular, present tense, active voice, indicative) respectively.

  2) disvā kammavisudhim attano (having seen his own good deeds). This clause is subordinated to the previous one. It is introduced by the verb disvā (having seen, gerund). The word kammavisuddhim (good deeds, accusative singular) forms an object. The word attano (one's own, genitive singular) is an attribute to the object.
17: |-
  The first line consists of loosely connected sentences. They are:

  1) idha tappati ([the wrongdoer] is tormented here). Here the subject is omitted (it is the word pāpakārī from the third sentence). The verb tappati (grieves) is in 3rd person singular, present tense, passive voice, indicative. The adverb idha (here) is an attribute to the verb.

  2) pecca socati ([the wrongdoer] is tormented after death). Again, the subject is the word pāpakārī from the following sentence. The verb is tappati (as above). The gerund pecca (having gone) is an attribute to the verb.

  3) pāpakārī ubhayattha tappati (the wrongdoer is tormented in both states). The subject of this sentence (and of the two previous ones) is the word pāpakārī (wrongdoer). It is in nominative singular. The verb is tappati (explained above). The adverb ubhayattha (in both places) serves as an attribute to the verb.

  The second line consists of two segments:

  1) pāpaṃ me katan ti tappati (He is tormented [by the thought] "I have done evil"). Here the subject is omitted, it is the word pāpakārī from the previous sentence and the verb is tappati (as above). There is a direct speech clause inserted -- pāpaṃ me katan ti. Here the subject is pāpaṃ (evil, nominative singular). And as a verb serves the past participle kataṃ (done, nominative singular). The pronoun me (by me, instrumental singular) is an attribute to the verb. The particle ti marks the end of the direct speech.

  2) bhiyyo tappati duggatiṃ gato (He is tormented even more, having gone to a bad birth). The sentence is introduced by the adverb bhiyyo (more). The subject is again the word pāpakārī from the first line. The verb is also tappati. The verb has an attribute -- the word gato (gone, past participle, nominative singular), which in turn has its own attribute duggatiṃ (to the bad birth, accusative singular).
18: |-
  The first line consists of loosely connected sentences. They are:

  1) idha nandati ([the well-doer] is delighted here). Here the subject is omitted (it is the word katapuñño from the third sentence). The verb nandati (is delighted) is in 3rd person singular, present tense, active voice, indicative. The adverb idha (here) is an attribute to the verb.

  2) pecca nandati ([the well-doer] is delighted after death). Again, the subject is the word katapuñño from the following sentence. The verb is nandati (as above). The gerund pecca (having gone) is an attribute to the verb.

  3) katapuñño ubhayattha nandati (the well-doer is delighted in both states). The subject of this sentence (and of the two previous ones) is the word katapuñño (well-doer). It is in nominative singular. The verb is nandati (explained above). The adverb ubhayattha (in both places) serves as an attribute to the verb.

  The second line consists of two segments:

  1) puññaṃ me katan ti nandati (He is delighted [by the thought] "I have done good"). Here the subject is omitted, it is the word katapuñño from the previous sentence and the verb is nandati (as above). There is a direct speech clause inserted - puññaṃ me katan ti. Here the subject is puññaṃ (good, nominative singular). And as a verb serves the past participle kataṃ (done, nominative singular). The pronoun me (by me, instrumental singular) is an attribute to the verb. The particle ti marks the end of the direct speech.

  2) bhiyyo nandati sugatiṃ gato (He is delighted even more, having gone to a good birth). The sentence is introduced by the adverb bhiyyo (more). The subject is again the word katapuñño from the first line. The verb is also nandati. The verb has an attribute - the word gato (gone, past participle, nominative singular), which in turn has its own attribute sugatiṃ (to the good birth, accusative singular).
19: |-
  The first segment of this sentence is bahum pi ce saṃhitaṃ bhāsamāno (even if [he] recites a lot of scriptures). The subject of this sentence is omitted, implying a personal pronoun (which comes in the last clause). The verb is bhāsamāno (which is the medium present participle in nominative singular). The object is the word saṃhitaṃ (scripture, accusative singular) with its attribute bahum (a lot, accusative singular). There are two particles pi (even) and ce (if).

  Next comes the clause na takkaro hoti (he is not a "doer-of-that"). Here the subject is the noun takkaro ("doer-of-that", nominative singular) and the verb is hoti (is, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense) negated by the negative particle na (not).

  The last clause on the first line is naro pamatto (negligent man). We can take this phrase as a separate clause (as we do here). In this case it is a isolated subject naro (man, nominative singular) with its attribute pamatto (negligent, nominative singular). We could also understand it as the subject of the whole sentence.

  On the second line we have two more clauses. The first one is gopo va gāvo gaṇayaṃ paresaṃ (like a cowherd, counting others' cows). The subject is gopo (cowherd, nominative singular) and as the verb serves the active present participle gaṇayaṃ (counting, nominative singular). The object is the word gāvo (cows, accusative plural) with its attribute paresaṃ (others', genitive plural). The particle va (like) connects this clause to the main sentence.

  Last part is the sentence na bhāgavā sāmaññassa hoti ([he] is not a sharer of the monkshood). As the subject is again implied the pronoun he, meaning the "negligent man" from the first line. The verb is hoti (is, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense) negated by the negative particle na (not). The object is the word bhāgavā (sharer, "shareholder", nominative singular) with its attribute sāmaññassa (of monkshood, genitive singular).
20: |-
  The first segment of this sentence is appam pi ce saṃhitaṃ bhāsamāno (even if [he] recites a little of scriptures). The subject of this sentence is omitted, implying a personal pronoun (which comes in the last clause). The verb is bhāsamāno (which is the medium present participle in nominative singular). The object is the word saṃhitaṃ (scripture, accusative singular) with its attribute appam (a little, accusative singular). There are two particles pi (even) and ce (if).

  The next segment is dhammassa hoti anudhammacārī ([he] lives in truth according to the Dharma). The subject here is again an omitted personal pronoun. The verb is hoti (is, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense). The object anudhammacārī (living in truth, nominative singular) has an attribute dhammassa (of the Dharma, according to the Dharma, genitive singular).

  Third segment is rāgañ ca dosañ ca pahāya mohaṃ. Again, the subject (personal pronoun) is omitted. As the verb serves the gerund pahāya. There is a triple object rāgañ, dosañ, mohaṃ (lust, hatred, delusion, respectively, all accusative singular). They are connected by two conjunctions ca (and) in the common way of Pali texts.

  Next two segments are just attributes to the main subject of the sentence, the personal pronoun sa (he) in the last clause. They are sammāppajāno (having the right knowledge, nominative singular) and suvimuttacitto (with a well emancipated mind, nominative singular).

  Next is the segment anupādiyāno idha vā huraṃ vā (not attached to anything, either in this world, nor in the other one). The subject is, as above the personal pronoun coming in the final clause. The verb is anupādiyāno (not attached, active present participle, in nominative singular). The object is double -- idha (here) and huraṃ (there), connected by two conjunctions vā (or) in the common way of Pali texts.

  Last part is the sentence sa bhāgavā sāmaññassa hoti (he is a sharer of the monkshood). The subject is the pronoun sa (he, nominative singular). The verb is hoti (is, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense). The object is the word bhāgavā (sharer, "shareholder", nominative singular) with its attribute sāmaññassa (of monkshood, genitive singular).
21: This verse consists of four practically separated sentences. First of them is
  appamādo amatapadaṃ (conscientiousness is the state of deathlessness). The subject
  is the word appamādo (conscientiousness, nominative singular). The verb to be is
  omitted. The object is the word amatapadaṃ (state of deathlessness, nominative singular).
  Second sentence is pamādo maccuno padaṃ (negligence is the state of death). The
  subject is the word pamādo (negligence, nominative singular). Again, the verb to
  be is omitted. The object is the word padaṃ (state, nominative singular) with the
  attribute maccuno (death's, genitive singular). Third sentence is appamattā na mīyanti
  (the conscientious ones do not die). Here the subject is appamattā (the conscientious
  ones, nominative plural). The verb here is mīyanti (die, 3rd person, plural, medium,
  indicative, present tense) and it is negated by the negative particle na (not).
  Last sentence is ye pamattā yathā matā (those, who are negligent, are as if dead).
  This is actually a compound sentence. The first half is ye pamattā(those, who are
  negligent). The subject is ye (those, who, nominative plural). The verb to be is
  omitted. The object is pamattā (negligent, nominative plural). The second part is
  yathā matā (as if dead). Here the subject should be te (they) but it is omitted,
  as is the verb to be. The object is the word matā (dead, nominative plural). The
  relative adverb yathā (as, like) connects the two halves of this sentence.
22: The first part of the sentence is evaṃ visesato ñatvā appamādamhi paṇḍitā (The
  wise ones, having thus distinctively understood about conscientiousness). The subject
  of this sentence is paṇḍitā (wise ones, nominative plural) and the verb is ñatvā
  (having known, gerund). The object is appamādamhi (about conscientiousness, locative
  singular). There are two adverbs, visesato (distinctively) and evaṃ (thus) complementing
  this sentence. The second part of the sentence is appamāde pamodanti (they rejoice
  in conscientiousness). The subject is the word paṇḍitā from the previous sentence.
  The verb is pamodanti (rejoice, 3rd person plural, active, indicative, present tense).
  The object is appamāde (in the conscientiousness, locative singular). Next follows
  the clause ariyānaṃ gocare ratā (delighting in the sphere of the Noble Ones). We
  can see the word ratā (delighting, nominative plural) as an attribute to the main
  subject of the sentence (the word paṇḍitā). The object here is gocare (in the sphere,
  locative singular) with its attribute ariyānaṃ (of the Noble Ones, genitive plural).
23: 'This verse forms one sentence. Its subject is the pronoun te (they, those, nominative
  plural). It has many attributes, which agree with it in case and number. They are:
  1) jhāyino (meditators, nominative plural), 2) sātatikā (perseverant, nominative
  plural), 3) daḷhaparakkamā (with strong effort, nominative plural) with its own
  attribute niccaṃ (constantly) and 4) dhīrā (wise ones, clever ones, nominative plural).
  The verb is phusanti (touch, 3rd person, plural, active, indicative, present tense).
  The object is nibbānaṃ (Nirvana, accusative singular), with the attribute yogakkhemaṃ
  (peace from bondage, accusative singular). This word itself has an attribute, the
  adjective anuttaraṃ (highest, accusative singular).'
24: 'The subject of this sentence is the word yaso (good repute, nominative singular).
  The verb is abhivaḍḍhati (grows, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present
  tense). The subject has seven attributes, all of which are in genitive singular.
  They are: uṭṭhānavato (of an energetic one), satīmato (of a mindful one), sucikammassa
  (of a person of pure deeds), nisammakārino (of one who is acting considerately),
  saññatassa (of a self-controlled one), dhammajīvino (of one living righteously)
  and appamattassa (of a conscientious one).'
25: 'The subject of this sentence is the word medhāvī (wise ones, nominative singular).
  The verb is kayirātha (you should do, 3rd person singular, medium, optative). The
  object is the word dīpaṃ (island, accusative singular). The verb has four attributes,
  all of which are in instrumental singular. They are: uṭṭhānena (by exertion), appamādena
  (by conscientiousness), saṃyamena (by self-control) and damena (by moderation).
  The conjunction ca (and) connects them all together. There is a subordinated clause,
  introduced by a relative pronoun, yaṃ (that, which, accusative singular). This refers
  to the object of the sentence, the word dīpaṃ. The subject in the clause is the
  word ogho (flood, nominative singular) and the verb abhikīrati (covers, overwhelms,
  3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense) negated by the negative
  particle na (not).'
26: 'The subject of the first sentence is bālā (fools, nominative plural). It has
  an attribute, the word janā (people, nominative plural) which has its own attribute
  dummedhino (ignorant, nominative singular). The verb is anuyuñjanti (pursue, 3rd
  person, plural, active, indicative, present tense). The object is pamādaṃ (negligence,
  accusative singular). In the second sentence, the subject is medhāvī (wise one,
  nominative singular). The verb is rakkhati (protects, 3rd person, singular, active,
  indicative, present tense). The object is appamādaṃ (conscientiousness, accusative
  singular). There is a subordinate clause to the object, introduced by the particle
  va (like, as): dhanaṃ seṭṭhaṃ. The main object here is dhanaṃ (treasure, accusative
  singular) and the adjective seṭṭhaṃ (best, accusative singular) is its attribute.'
27: The subject in the first sentence is omitted (since it is the personal pronoun
  "you", it is not necessary). The verb is anuyuñjetha (pursue, 2nd person, plural,
  active, imperative) with two negative particles mā (don't). There are two objects
  pamādaṃ (negligence, accusative singular) and kāmaratisanthavaṃ (intimacy with pleasure
  delights, accusative singular). In the second sentence, the subject is jhāyanto
  (meditating one, nominative singular) with its attribute appamato (conscientious,
  nominative singular). The verb is pappoti (obtains, 3rd person, singular, active,
  indicative, present tense). The object is sukhaṃ (happiness, accusative singular)
  with its attribute, the adjective vipulaṃ (abundant, accusative singular). There
  is a particle hi (indeed) in this sentence, mainly for metrical purposes.
28: 'This verse is composed of two sentences. The first one is: pamādaṃ appamādena
  yadā nudati paṇḍito paññāpāsādam āruyha asoko (When the wise one expels negligence
  by conscientiousness, having climbed the stronghold of wisdom, without sorrow).
  The subject is the word paṇḍito (wise one, nominative singular), with a attribute
  asoko (sorrowless, nominative singular). The verb is nudati (expels, 3rd person,
  singular, active, indicative, present tense). The object is pamādaṃ (negligence,
  accusative singular) with its attribute appamādena (by conscientiousness, instrumental
  singular). There is a subordinated clause paññāpāsādam āruyha (having climbed the
  stronghold of wisdom). Here the verb is āruyha (having climbed, gerund) and the
  object paññāpāsādam (the stronghold of wisdom, accusative singular). The whole sentence
  is introduced by the relative adverb yadā (when). The second sentence is sokiniṃ
  pajaṃ pabbataṭṭho va bhūmaṭṭhe dhīro bāle avekkhati (such a clever one observes
  the sorrowing crowd as somebody standing on a mountain observes the foolish people
  on the ground). We would expect the adverb tadā (then) as a counterbalance of the
  relative adverb yadā (when) in the first sentence, but it is not really necessary.
  We can further analyze this sentence into two segments: dhīro sokiniṃ pajaṃ avekkhati
  (the clever one observes sorrowing crowd). Here the subject is dhīro (clever one,
  nominative singular) and the verb avekkhati (observes, 3rd person, singular, active,
  indicative, present tense). The object is pajaṃ (crowd, accusative singular) with
  an attribute sokiniṃ (sorrowing, accusative singular). The second segment is a simile:
  pabbataṭṭho va bhūmaṭṭhe bāle (as somebody standing on a mountain [observes] fools
  standing on the ground). Here, the subject is pabbataṭṭho (standing on a mountain,
  nominative singular). The verb is missing, the word avekkhati from the first segment
  is implied. The object is bāle (fools, accusative plural) with its attribute bhūmaṭṭhe
  (standing on the ground, accusative plural).'
29: The subject of the sentence is the word sumedhaso (wise one, nominative singular).
  The verb is yāti (goes, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense).
  The subject has two attributes. They are 1) appamatto (conscientious, nominative
  singular) with its own attribute pamattesu (amongst negligent ones, locative plural)
  and 2) bahujāgaro (very watchful, nominative singular) with its attribute suttesu
  (amongst sleeping ones, locative plural). The sentence has a clause, abalassaṃ va
  sīghasso hitvā (like a swift horse, having left behind a weak horse). Here, the
  subject is sīghasso (a swift horse, nominative singular). The gerund hitvā (having
  abandoned) serves as a verb. The object is abalassaṃ (a weak horse, accusative singular).
30: |-
  This gatha consists of three grammatically separated sentences. They are:

  1) appamādena maghavā devānaṃ seṭṭhataṃ gato (by conscientiousness did Indra become the chief amongst the gods). Here the subject is the word maghavā (Indra, nominative singular). The past participle gato (gone) serves as a verb in this sentence. It has an attribute, the word appamādena (by conscientiousness, instrumental singular). The object is seṭṭhataṃ (to the foremost place, accusative singular) with its attribute devānaṃ (of the gods, genitive plural).

  2) appamādaṃ pasaṃsanti (they praise conscientiousness). The subject is omitted, the personal pronoun "they" is supposed here. The verb is pasaṃsanti (praise, 3rd person, plural, active, indicative, present tense). The object is appamādaṃ (conscientiousness, accusative singular).

  3) pamādo garahito sadā (negligence is always censured). The subject here is the word pamādo (negligence, nominative singular). The verb is the past participle garahito (blamed, censured, nominative singular). It has an attribute, the adverb sadā (always).
31: The subject of this sentence is the word bhikkhu (monk, nominative singular) with
  two attributes, appamādarato (devoted to conscientiousness, nominative singular)
  and bhayadassi (fearful, nominative singular) with its own attribute pamāde (in
  negligence, locative singular). They are connected by the conjunction vā (or). The
  verb here is gacchati (goes, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense).
  There is a clause, saṃyojanaṃ aṇuṃ thūlaṃ ḍahaṃ (burning the fetter, small and big).
  Here the subject is still the word bhikkhu from the main sentence, the verb is ḍahaṃ
  (active present participle) and the object is saṃyojanaṃ (the fetter, accusative
  singular) with two attributes aṇuṃ (small, accusative singular) and thūlaṃ (big,
  accusative singular). The last clause is aggī va (like a fire), where the subject
  is aggī (fire, nominative singular) and the verb is the same as in the main sentence
  (gacchati). The particle va (as, like) connects this clause to the main sentence.
32: The subject of this sentence is the word bhikkhu (monk, nominative singular) with
  three attributes, appamādarato (devoted to conscientiousness, nominative singular)
  and bhayadassi (fearful, nominative singular) with its own attribute pamāde (in
  negligence, locative singular). They are connected by the conjuction vā (or). The
  third attribute is abhabbo (unable, nominative singular) with its own attribute
  parihānāya (of regress, dative singular). The verb here is omitted, implying the
  verb "to be". The attribute to this verb is the word santike (in the vicinity, locative
  singular) with its attribute nibbānassa (of the Nirvana, genitive singular). The
  particle eva (just) serves as strengthening particle.
33: 'The subject of this sentence is the word medhāvī (wise one, nominative singular)
  and the verb is karoti (does, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative present tense)
  with an attribute ujuṃ (straight, accusative singular). In fact, we can consider
  the whole phrase ujuṃ + karoti (makes straight) as a verbal phrase ujuṃkaroti (straightens),
  as is quite common in Classical Sanskrit. The object is the word cittaṃ (mind, accusative
  singular). It has four attributes: phandanaṃ (wavering), capalaṃ (unsteady), dūrakkhaṃ
  (hard to guard) and dunnivārayaṃ (difficult to restrain). They all agree with the
  object, so they are in accusative singular. There is a clause, usukāro va tejanaṃ
  (like an arrow-maker an arrow). Here, the subject is usukāro (arrow-maker, nominative
  singular). As verb serves the verbal phrase from the main sentence (ujuṃ karoti,
  straightens). The object is tejanaṃ (arrow, accusative singular). The particle va
  (as, like) connects the clause to the main sentence.'
34: 'The subject of this sentence is the word cittaṃ (mind, nominative singular) with
  its attribute, demonstrative pronoun idaṃ (this, nominative singular). The verb
  is pariphandati (trembles, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense).
  The first part of the verse forms a subordinate clause to the main sentence: vārijo
  va thale khitto okamokata ubbhato (Like a fish, thrown from all abodes on a dry
  ground). Here, the subject is vārijo (fish, nominative singular). The past participle
  khitto (thrown, nominative singular) fulfills the role of the verb. The object is
  thale (on the ground, locative singular). Two adverbs (okamokata, from all abodes;
  ubbhato, both) are attributes to the past participle khitto. The particle va (as,
  like) connects this clause to the main sentence. The end of the verse forms another
  clause. It expresses the reason for the action in main sentence. There is a verb
  in its infinitive form. It is so called dative infinitive. Thus pahātave means "in
  order to leave". The object is māradheyyaṃ (Mara''s realm, accusative singular).'
35: 'This verse consists of two grammatically separated sentences. One is: dunniggahassa
  lahuno yatthakāmanipātino cittassa damatho sādhu (good is the taming of the mind,
  which is difficult to restrain, quick, jumping at whatever it desires). Here the
  subject is damatho (taming, nominative singular). The verb is omitted, therefore
  we have to supply the verb "to be". An attribute to this verb is the adverb sādhu
  (well). The object is the word cittassa (of the mind, genitive singular). It has
  three attributes; 1) dunniggahassa (of the difficult to restrain one), 2) lahuno
  (of the quick one), 3) yatthakāmanipātino (of the jumping-at-whatever-it-desires
  one). They all have to agree with the object and are therefore in genitive singular.
  The second sentence is cittaṃ dantaṃ sukhāvahaṃ (restrained mind brings happiness).
  Here the subject is the word cittaṃ (mind, nominative singular). It has an attribute,
  the past participle dantaṃ (restrained, nominative singular). The verb is again
  omitted, the verb "to be" again being implied. The word sukhāvahaṃ (happiness-bringing,
  nominative singular) forms an attribute to this verb.'
36: 'This verse consists of two grammatically separated sentences. One is: sududdasaṃ
  sunipuṇaṃ yatthakāmanipātinaṃ cittaṃ rakkhetha medhāvī (o Wise Ones, you should
  protect the mind, which is very difficult to see, very subtle and jumping at whatever
  it desires). Here the subject is the word medhāvī (o Wise Ones, vocative plural).
  The verb is rakkhetha (you should protect, 2nd person plural, active, optative).
  The object is cittaṃ (mind, accusative singular) with three attributes: 1) sududdasaṃ
  (very difficult to see), 2) sunipuṇaṃ (very subtle), 3) yatthakāmanipātinaṃ (jumping
  at whatever it desires). They all have to agree with the object and are therefore
  in accusative singular. The second sentence is cittaṃ guttaṃ sukhāvahaṃ (restrained
  mind brings happiness). Here the subject is the word cittaṃ (mind, nominative singular).
  It has an attribute, the past participle guttaṃ (protected, nominative singular).
  The verb is omitted, the verb "to be" again being implied. The word sukhāvahaṃ (happiness-bringing,
  nominative singular) forms an attribute to this verb.'
37: 'This verse contains two sentences. First is dūraṅgamaṃ ekacaraṃ asarīraṃ guhāsayaṃ
  ye cittaṃ saṃyamissanti (Those, who can restrain the mind, which is going far, wandering
  alone, bodiless and living in the cave). Here, the subject is the relative pronoun
  ye (those, who; nominative plural). The verb is saṃyamissanti (will restrain, 3rd
  person, plural, active, future tense). The object is the word cittaṃ (mind, accusative
  singular) with its four attributes. They are: 1) dūraṅgamaṃ (going far), 2) ekacaraṃ
  (wandering alone), 3) asarīraṃ (bodiless), 4) guhāsayaṃ (living in the cave). They
  all have to agree with the object and are therefore in accusative singular. The
  rest of the verse forms the second sentence: mokkhanti mārabandhanā ([they] will
  be freed from the bond of Mara). The subject is missing here, we have to supply
  a personal pronoun te (they, nominative plural), that should form the second part
  of the paradigm relative pronoun - personal pronoun (ye - te). The verb is mokkhanti
  (will be freed, 3rd person, plural, passive, future tense). The object is mārabandhanā
  (from the bond of Mara, ablative singular).'
38: 'The subject of this sentence is the word paññā (wisdom, nominative singular)
  and the verb is paripūrati (becomes perfect, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative,
  present tense) which is negated by the negative particle na. The subject has three
  attributes, namely: 1) anavaṭṭhitacittassa (of the unsteady-minded one, genitive
  singular), 2) avijānato (of the not understanding one, genitive singular); this
  word has its own attribute, the word saddhammaṃ (the true Dharma, accusative singular)
  and 3) pariplavapasādassa (of the one, whose confidence is wavering, genitive singular).'
39: 'The subject of the sentence is the word bhayaṃ (fear, nominative singular) and
  the verb is atthi (is, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense)
  negated by the negative particle na (not). There is a multiple object, consisting
  of four words: 1) anavassutacittassa (of the one, whose mind is not filled with
  desires), 2) ananvāhatacetaso (of the one, whose mind is not perplexed), 3) puññapāpapahīnassa
  (of the one, who has abandoned the idea of "good" and "bad") and 4) jāgarato (of
  the watchful one). They all have to agree and are therefore in genitive singular.'
40: |-
  This verse consists of five grammatically separated sentences. They are: 1) kumbhūpamaṃ kāyam imaṃ viditvā (having understood this body to be like a jar). Here the subject is omitted. The verb is in the gerundive, viditvā (having understood). The object is formed of the words kāyaṃ (body, accusative singular) and imaṃ (this, accusative singular). It has an attribute, the compound kumbhūpamaṃ (similar to a jar, accusative singular).

  2) nagarūpamaṃ cittaṃ idaṃ ṭhapetvā (having established this mind like a city). Again, the object is missing here. The verb is again a gerundive, ṭhapetvā (having established). The object is formed of the words cittaṃ (mind, accusative singular) and idaṃ (this, accusative singular). It has an attribute, nagarūpamaṃ (similar to a city, accusative singular).

  3) yodhetha māraṃ paññāyudhena (attack Mara with the weapon of wisdom). The object is the pronoun you, but it is omitted ,since in the Pali sentence it is not necessary. The verb is yodhetha (you should attack, 2nd person, plural, active, imperative). The verb has an attribute, the word paññāyudhena (by the weapon of wisdom, instrumental singular). The object of the sentence is the word māraṃ (Mara, accusative singular).

  4) jitaṃ ca rakkhe (one should protect the conquered [territory]). Again, as the subject is clear from the verb, the actual pronoun (in this case he/she) is not needed. The verb is rakkhe (he should protect, 3rd person, singular, active, optative). Note the change of the subject - from the second person plural in the previous sentence to the third person singular in this one. The object is jitaṃ (the conquered [territory], accusative singular). The conjunction ca (and) connects this sentence to the previous one.

  5) anivesano siyā (one should be without attachments). As before, the subject (he/she) is omitted. The verb is siyā (one should be, 3rd person, singular, active, optative). It has an attachment, the word anivesano (without attachments, nominative singular).
41: 'The subject of the main sentence is the word kāyo (body, nominative singular).
  It has three attributes: the pronoun ayaṃ (this, nominative singular), the adjective
  chuddho (discarded, nominative singular) and the compound apetaviññāṇo (devoid of
  consciousness, nominative singular). The verb is adhisessati (will lay upon, 3rd
  person, singular, active, future tense). It has one attribute, the adverb aciraṃ
  (shortly, before long). The object is the noun pathaviṃ (on the ground, accusative
  singular). The interjection vata (alas) is syntactically independent. The sentence
  has a clause, niratthaṃ va kaliṅgaraṃ (like a worthless log). The noun kaliṅgaraṃ
  (log, nominative singular) is the subject of this clause. It has an attribute, the
  adjective niratthaṃ (worthless, nominative singular). The verb and object are omitted,
  both of them are to be taken from the main sentence (i.e. pathaviṃ adhissesati).
  The particle va (as, like) connects the clause to the main sentence.'
42: 'The main sentence is in the second line. Here, the subject of the sentence is
  the word cittaṃ (mind, nominative singular). It has an attribute, the compound micchāpaṇihitaṃ
  (wrongly directed, nominative singular). The verb is kare (can do, 3rd person, singular,
  active, optative) with an attribute, the indeclinable adverb pāpiyo (worse). The
  object is naṃ (him, accusative singular). The adverb tato (than that) connects the
  main sentence to the relative clause in the first line. The relative clause consists
  of two parts: 1) diso disaṃ yaṃ taṃ kayirā (whatever an enemy might do to an enemy).
  Here, the subject is the word diso (enemy, nominative singular) and the verb kayirā
  (would do, 3rd person, singular, active, optative). The object is the noun disaṃ
  (to the enemy, accusative singular). The phrase yaṃ - taṃ (what - that) we should
  rather take as one adverbial phrase (whatever). 2) verī vā pana verinaṃ (or a hater
  to a hater). The subject is the noun verī (hater, nominative singular) and the object
  verinaṃ (to a hater, accusative singular). The verb is omitted, kayirā (would do)
  from the previous sentence is implied. The particle pana (indeed) is here only for
  metrical purposes. The conjunction vā (or) connects these two parts of the relative
  clause.'
43: 'The two lines form two sentences. In the first one, the subject is triple: mātā
  (mother), pitā (father) and ñātakā (relatives). They are all in nominative singular,
  except for the last one (ñātakā), which is in nominative plural. This word has an
  attribute, the adjective aññe (others, nominative plural). The verb is kayirā (can
  do, 3rd person, singular, active, optative), negated by the negative particle na
  (not). The object is the pronoun taṃ (that, accusative singular). The three conjunctions
  (vā, or; pi, also; ca, and) connect the subjects together, but mainly they serve
  metrical purposes. In the second sentence, the subject is the word cittaṃ (mind,
  nominative singular). It has an attribute, the compound sammāpaṇihitaṃ (well directed,
  nominative singular). The verb is kare (can do, 3rd person, singular, active, optative)
  with an attribute, the adverb seyyaso (even better). The object is naṃ (him, accusative
  singular). The adverb tato (than that) connects this sentence to the first one.'
44: 'The two lines of this verse form two syntactically separated sentences. In the
  first one, the subject is the interrogative pronoun ko (who, nominative singular).
  The verb is vicessati (will investigate, 3rd person, singular, active, future tense).
  There are two paratactic objects: pathaviṃ (earth, accusative singular) with the
  attribute imaṃ (this, accusative singular) and yamalokaṃ (Yama''s world, accusative
  singular) with two attributes, imaṃ (as above) and sadevakaṃ (with the gods, accusative
  singular). These two objects are connected by the conjunction ca (and). In the second
  sentence, the subjects is again the interrogative pronoun ko (as above). The verb
  is pacessati ("will understand" and "will pick", 3rd person, singular, active, future
  tense). The object is the noun dhammapadaṃ (verse on the Dharma, accusative singular)
  with one attribute, the adjective sudesitaṃ (well taught, accusative singular).
  There is a parenthetic clause, kusalo puppham iva (like a skilful [one] flowers).
  Here the noun-adjective kusalo (skilful [one], nominative singular) is the subject.
  The object is the noun puppham (flower, accusative singular). The verb is not in
  the clause itself, implying the verb pacessati from the main sentence. The particle
  iva (as, like) connects the clause to the sentence.'
45: 'The two lines of this verse form two syntactically separated sentences. In the
  first one, the subject is the noun sekho (disciple, nominative singular). The verb
  is vicessati (will investigate, 3rd person, singular, active, future tense). There
  are two paratactic objects: pathaviṃ (earth, accusative singular) and yamalokaṃ
  (Yama''s world, accusative singular) with two attributes, imaṃ (as above) and sadevakaṃ
  (with the gods, accusative singular). These two objects are connected by the conjunction
  ca (and). In the second sentence, the subjects is again the noun sekho (as above).
  The verb is pacessati ("will understand" and "will pick", 3rd person, singular,
  active, future tense). The object is the noun dhammapadaṃ (verse on the Dharma,
  accusative singular) with one attribute, the adjective sudesitaṃ (well taught, accusative
  singular). There is a parenthetic clause, kusalo puppham iva (like a skilful [one]
  flowers). Here the noun-adjective kusalo (skilful [one], nominative singular) is
  the subject. The object is the noun puppham (flower, accusative singular). The verb
  is not in the clause itself, implying the verb pacessati from the main sentence.
  The particle iva (as, like) connects the clause to the sentence.'
46: 'There are four rather separate sentences in this verse, although the last one
  can be considered as the main sentence. They are: 1) pheṇūpamaṃ kāyam imaṃ viditvā
  (having understood that this body is like foam). The subject is omitted. Any third
  person singular personal pronoun can be used. The verb is in the gerundive, viditvā
  (having understood). The main object is the noun kāyaṃ (body, accusative singular).
  It has two attributes, imaṃ (this, accusative singular) and pheṇūpamaṃ (like foam,
  accusative singular). 2) marīcidhammaṃ abhisambudhāno (having realized its mirage-like
  nature). The verb is again in the gerundive, abhisambudhāno (having realized). The
  object is the word marīcidhammaṃ (mirage-like nature, accusative singular). 3) chetvāna
  mārassa papupphakāni (having cut off Mara''s flower-tipped arrows). Again, the verb
  is a gerundive, chetvāna (having cut off). The object is the noun papupphakāni (flower-tipped
  [arrows], nominative plural) with an attribute, the noun mārassa (Mara''s, genitive
  singular). 4) adassanaṃ maccurājassa gacche (one should make himself invisible to
  the King of Death). The verb is in the optative, gacche (3rd person, singular, active,
  optative). The object is the noun adassanaṃ (to the invisibility, accusative singular)
  with an attribute, the word maccurājassa (of the King of Death, genitive singular).'
47: The phrase ādaya gacchati can be literally translated as "goes, having taken",
  but rather has the meaning of "carries away". The subject of this verse is the noun
  maccu (death, nominative singular). The verbal phrase ādāya gacchati (having taken,
  goes) serves as the verb in this sentence. The object is the noun naraṃ (man, accusative
  singular). The object has two attributes, byāsattamanasaṃ (with an attached mind,
  accusative singular) and pacinantaṃ (gathering, accusative singular). This last
  word has its own attribute, the noun pupphāni (flowers, accusative plural). The
  two particles, hi (indeed) and eva (just, only) are here mainly for metrical purposes.
  There is a subordinate clause in this sentence, suttaṃ gāmaṃ mah'ogho va (like a
  great flood the sleeping village). The subject here is the compound mahogho (great
  flood, nominative singular) and the object the noun gāmaṃ (village, accusative singular)
  with its attribute, the past participle suttaṃ (sleeping, accusative singular).
  The verb is omitted, implying the verbal phrase ādāya gacchati from the main sentence.
  The particle va (as, like) connects the clause to the main sentence.
48: 'The subject of this sentence is the noun antako (Death, nominative singular).
  The verbal phrase kurute vasaṃ (makes control; 3rd person, singular, medium, indicative
  present tense; and accusative singular) fulfills the role of a verb in this sentence.
  The object is the noun naraṃ (man, accusative singular). It has three attributes:
  1) pupphāni heva pacinantaṃ (only gathering flowers). The main object is the active
  present participle pacinantaṃ (gathering, accusative singular) and the noun pupphāni
  (flowers, accusative plural) is its attribute. Two particles, hi (indeed) and eva
  (just, only) are here mainly for metrical purposes. 2) byāsattamanasaṃ (having attached
  mind, accusative singular). 3) atittañ eva kāmesu (unsatisifed in sense pleasures).
  The main object is the past participle atittañ (unsatisfied, accusative singular)
  and the noun kāmesu (in sense pleasures, locative plural) is its attribute. The
  particle eva (just, only) serves only metrical purposes.'
49: 'This verse has two parenthetic sentences: 1) yathā pi bhamaro pupphaṃ vaṇṇagandhaṃ
  aheṭhayaṃ paleti rasam ādāya (just like a bee leaves the flower, not hurting the
  color and smell, having taken its juice). The subject of this sentence is the noun
  bhamaro (bee, nominative singular) and there is also a clause vaṇṇagandhaṃ ahethayaṃ
  (not hurting the color and smell; accusative singular; and active present participle,
  nominative singular). The verb is paleti (leaves, 3rd person, singular, active,
  indicative, present tense). There is a verbal clause, rasam ādāya (having taken
  the juice; accusative singular; and gerundive). The object is the noun pupphaṃ (flower,
  accusative singular). The relative adverb yathā (just as), which forms a quite common
  phrase yathā pi (same meaning) with the conjunction pi (also), connects this sentence
  to the next one. 2) evaṃ gāme munī care (so should a wise man walk through the village).
  The subject is the noun munī (wise man, nominative singular) and the verb care (should
  walk, 3rd person, singular, active, optative). The object is the noun gāme (through
  the village, locative singular). The adverb evaṃ (thus, so) connects this sentence
  to the previous one.'
50: The two lines of this verse form two parenthetic sentences. There is no subject
  in any of them. The third person singular pronoun is implied. In the first sentence,
  the verb is omitted. The verb avekkheyya from the second sentence serves also as
  the verb for this sentence, but it is negated by two negative particles na (not).
  There are two objects, vilomāni (wrong deeds, accusative plural) and katākataṃ (what
  is done and undone, accusative singular). They both have an attribute, the adjective
  paresaṃ (others', genitive plural). In the second sentence, the verb is avekkheyya
  (one should look at, 3rd person, singular, medium, optative). There are two objects,
  katāni (what is done, accusative plural) and akatāni (what is undone, accusative
  plural). They are connected by the conjunction ca (and). The objects have an attribute,
  the pronoun attano (oneself's, genitive singular) which is strengthened by the particle
  va (more often as eva; just, only).
51: 'The two lines of this verse form two sentences. In the first one, the subject
  is pupphaṃ (flower, nominative singular) with three attributes: 1) ruciraṃ (beautiful,
  nominative singular), 2) vaṇṇavantaṃ (colorful, nominative singular) and 3) agandhakaṃ
  (without smell, nominative singular). The verb is omitted, implying the verb "to
  be" (hoti from the second line). The relative adverb yathā (just as), which forms
  a quite common phrase yathā pi (same meaning) with the conjunction pi (also), connects
  this sentence to the next one. In the second sentence, the subject is the word vācā
  (speech, nominative singular), with two attributes, the adjective subhāsitā (well
  said, nominative singular) and the active present participle akubbato (of the not
  doing one, genitive singular). The verb is hoti (is, 3rd person, singular, active,
  indicative, present tense). The object is the adjective aphalā (fruitless, nominative
  singular). The adverb evaṃ (thus, so) connects this sentence to the previous one.'

  is pupphaṃ (flower, nominative singular) with three attributes: 1) ruciraṃ (beautiful,
  nominative singular), 2) vaṇṇavantaṃ (colorful, nominative singular) and 3) sagandhakaṃ

  present tense). The object is the adjective aphalā (fruitful, nominative singular).
  The adverb evaṃ (thus, so) connects this sentence to the previous one.'
53: In the first sentence (the first line) the subject is omitted. A third person
  singular pronoun is meant. The verb is the optative kāyirā (can do, 3rd person,
  singular, active, optative). The verb has an attribute, the compound puppharāsimhā
  (from the heap of flowers, ablative singular). The object is the noun mālāguṇe (garlands,
  accusative plural). It has an attribute, the adjective bahū (many, accusative plural).
  The relative adverb yathā (just as), which forms quite a common phrase yathā pi
  (same meaning) with the conjunction pi (also), connects this sentence to the next
  one. The second sentence (second line) is passive. The subject is the word maccena
  (by a mortal, instrumental singular) with an attribute, the past participle jātena
  (by a born, instrumental singular). The verb is in the gerund, kattabbaṃ (should
  be done, nominative singular). The object is the noun kusalaṃ (merit, nominative
  singular) with the adjective bahuṃ (nominative singular) as an attribute.
54: 'This verse forms four syntactically separated sentences. They are: 1) na pupphagandho
  paṭivātam eti (the scent of flowers does not go against the wind). The subject of
  this sentence is the noun pupphagandho (scent of flowers, nominative singular).
  The verb is eti (goes, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense),
  which is negated by the negative particle na (not). The verb has an attribute, the
  adverb paṭivātam (against the wind). 2) na candanaṃ tagaramallikā vā (nor [does]
  tagara or jasmine). There are two subjects in this sentence, candanaṃ (sandal, nominative
  singular) and tagaramallikā (tagara and jasmine, nominative singular). They are
  connected by the conjunction vā (or). There is a negative particle na (not) in this
  sentence, which negates the verb eti (goes) from the previous sentence. In this
  sentence the verb is omitted. 3) sataṃ ca gandho paṭivātam eti (the scent of true
  ones goes against the wind). The subject here is the noun gandho (smell, nominative
  singular) with an attribute, the adjective sataṃ (of the true ones, genitive plural).
  The verb is eti (goes, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense)
  with an attribute, the adverb paṭivātam (against the wind). The conjunction ca (and)
  connects this sentence to the two previous ones. 4) sabbā disā sappuriso pavāyati
  (the true person pervades all directions). The subject is the noun sappuriso (true
  person, nominative singular). The verb is pavāyati (pervades, 3rd person, singular,

55: The subject of this sentence is the word sīlagandho (the scent of virtue, nominative
  singular). It has an attribute, the adjective anuttaro (highest, nominative singular).
  There is no verb in this sentence, implying the verb "to be". The object is the
  word gandhajātānaṃ (of the kinds of smell, genitive plural). It has an attribute,
  the pronoun etesaṃ (of these, genitive plural). The first line of this verse is
  formed by a list of four nouns. They are all in nominative singular and are connected
  by the conjunctions vā pi (or also) and atha (and also, and then). They are candanaṃ
  (sandal), tagaraṃ (tagara), uppalaṃ (lotus) and vassikī (jasmine). This list forms
  an attribute to the object etesaṃ gandhajātānaṃ.
56: Two lines of this verse form two syntactically separated sentences. In the first
  sentence, subject is the noun gandho (smell, nominative singular). It has an attribute,
  the pronoun ayaṃ (this, nominative singular). The verb is omitted, implying the
  verb "to be". It has the adjective appamatto (faint, nominative singular) as a predicate.
  There is a clause, yā ayaṃ tagaracandanī (namely, this tagara and sandal). Here,
  the subject is the compound tagaracandanī (tagara and sandal, nominative singular).
  It has the pronoun ayaṃ (this, nominative singular) as an attribute. The relative
  pronoun yā (that, which; nominative singular) connects the clause to the main sentence.
  In the second line, the subject is the noun gandho (smell, nominative singular)
  with two attributes, the adjective uttamo (highest, nominative singular) and the
  adjective sīlavataṃ (of the virtuous ones, genitive plural). The verb is vāti (blows,
  3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense) with an attribute, the
  noun devesu (amongst the gods, locative plural). The relative pronoun yo (that,
  which; nominative singular) introduces the sentence and also connects it to the
  previous one. The conjunction ca (and) serves a similar purpose.
57: 'The subject of this sentence is the noun māro (Mara, nominative singular). The
  verb is vindati (finds or knows, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present
  tense), negated by the negative particle na (not). The object is the noun maggaṃ
  (way, path, accusative singular). The object has four attributes, the main one being
  the pronoun tesaṃ (their, genitive plural). Three more attributes are all in genitive
  plural. They are: 1) sampannasīlānaṃ (of virtue-endowed ones, genitive plural),
  2) appamādavihārinaṃ (of those, dwelling in conscientiousness). 3) sammadaññāvimuttānaṃ
  (of those, freed by the right knowledge).'
58: The subject of this sentence is the noun padumaṃ (lotus, nominative singular).
  It has two attributes, adjectives sucigandhaṃ (of pure smell, nominative singular)
  and manoramaṃ (delightful, nominative singular). The verb is jāyetha (3rd person,
  singular, medium, optative). It has two attributes, the adverb tattha (there) and
  the noun saṅkāradhānasmiṃ (at the rubbish heap, locative singular). This last noun
  has its own attribute, the noun mahāpathe (on the big road, locative singular) with
  the past participle ujjhitasmiṃ (on the thrown out, locative singular) as an attribute.
  The relative adverb yathā (just as) introduces this sentence and connects it to
  the next verse (DhP 59).
59: The subject of this sentence is the word sammāsambuddhasāvako (the disciple of
  the truly and completely Awakened One, nominative singular). The verb is atirocati
  (magnificently shines, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense).
  Main attribute to the verb is the noun paññāya (by wisdom, instrumental singular).
  There are two more attributes of place, saṅkārabhūtesu (amongst dust-like beings,
  locative plural) and puthujjane (amongst ordinary people, locative singular). This
  last noun has itself one attribute, the adjective andhabhūte (ignorant, blinded,
  locative singular). The adverb evaṃ (thus) introduces the sentence and connects
  it to the previous one (DhP 58).
60: This verse consists of three syntactically separated sentences. The first sentence
  is dīghā jāgarato ratti (long is the night for a wakeful). Here, the subject is
  the word ratti (night, nominative singular). It has the adjective dīghā (long, nominative
  singular) as an attribute. The verb is omitted, implying the verb "to be". The object
  is the active present participle jāgarato (for the wakeful, genitive singular).
  The second sentence is dīghaṃ santassa yojanaṃ (long is a yojana for a tired). The
  subject is the word yojanaṃ (yojana, nominative singular) with the adjective dīghaṃ
  (long, nominative singular) as an attribute. The verb is again omitted, as before
  implying the verb "to be". The object is the past participle santassa (for a tired,
  genitive singular). The third sentence is dīgho bālānaṃ saṃsāro saddhammaṃ avijānataṃ
  (long is the samsara for the fools who do not know the true Dharma). The subject
  is the noun saṃsāro (samsara, nominative singular) with an attribute, the adjective
  dīgho (long, nominative singular). As before, the verb is "to be", therefore it
  is not really needed and is omitted. The object is the noun bālānaṃ (for the fools,
  genitive plural). It has an attribute, the active present participle avijānataṃ
  (for the not knowing, genitive plural). This word has itself an attribute, the noun
  saddhammaṃ (the true Dharma, accusative singular).
61: 'There are two sentences in this verse: 1) caraṃ ce nādhigaccheyya seyyaṃ sadisam
  attano ekacariyaṃ daḷhaṃ kayirā (if a wanderer should not find a companion better
  or similar to oneself, then he should resolutely wander alone). This sentence can
  be further divided into two sentences. a) First is caraṃ ce nādhigaccheyya seyyaṃ
  sadisam attano (if a wanderer should not find a companion better or similar to oneself).
  The subject of this sentence is the active present participle caraṃ (wanderer, nominative
  singular). The verb is adhigaccheyya (should find, 3rd person, singular, active,
  optative) negated by the negative particle na (not). There are two objects, seyyaṃ
  (better, accusative singular) and sadisam (similar, accusative singular) which share
  the same attribute, the noun/reflexive pronoun attano (one self''s, genitive singular).
  The particle ce (if) connects the sentence to the following one. b) The second sentence
  is ekacariyaṃ daḷhaṃ kayirā (he should resolutely wander alone). Here, the subject
  is omitted; the active present participle caraṃ from the first sentence is implied.
  The verb is kayirā (should do, 3rd person, singular, active, optative) with the
  adjective daḷhaṃ (strong, accusative singular) as an attribute. The object of this
  sentence is the noun ekacariyaṃ (wandering alone, accusative singular). 2) natthi
  bāle sahāyatā (there is no companionship with a fool). The subject of this sentence
  is the noun sahāyatā (companionship, nominative singular). The noun is atthi (is,
  3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense) negated by the negative
  particle na (not). The object is the word bāle (with the fool, in the fool, locative
  singular).'
62: 'This verse consists of four loosely connected sentences. They are: 1) puttā matthi
  dhanaṃ matthi iti bālo vihaññati (the fool worries: "I have sons, I have wealth".
  Here, the subject of the main sentence is the noun bālo (fool, nominative singular).
  The verb is vihaññati (worries, 3rd person, singular, passive, indicative, present
  tense). There is a direct speech clause, which is connected to the main sentence
  by the particle iti (marks the direct speech). In this clause, there are two sentences:
  puttā me atthi (I have sons). Here the subject is the noun puttā (nominative plural)
  and the verb is atthi (is, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense).
  It has the pronoun me (my, genitive singular) as an attribute. The use of the singular
  in the verb is quite strange, we would rather expect plural. The second sentence
  in the clause is dhanaṃ me atthi (I have wealth). The subject is the noun dhanaṃ
  (wealth, nominative singular) and the verb is again atthi (is, as above) with an
  attribute, the pronoun me (my, as above). 2) attā hi attano natthi (he does not
  even own himself). The subject is the noun/reflexive pronoun attā (self, nominative
  singular). The verb is again atthi (is, as above) which is negated by the negative
  particle na (not). The verb has an attribute, the noun/reflexive pronoun attano
  (one self''s, genitive singular). The particle hi (indeed, even) just strengthens
  the sentence and serves mainly metrical purposes. 3) kuto puttā (Whence sons?).
  The subject is the noun puttā (sons, nominative plural). The verb is omitted, implying
  the verb "to be". The adverb kuto (whence?) can be seen as an attribute to this
  verb. 4) kuto dhanaṃ (Whence wealth?). The subject is the noun dhanaṃ (wealth, nominative
  singular). As above, the verb is omitted and the adverb kuto (whence?) serves as
  its attribute.'
63: 'This verse consists of two syntactically separated sentences. In each line ther
  is one sentence. The first sentence can be further subdivided into two sentences.
  They are: 1) yo bālo maññati bālyaṃ (a fool who knows about his foolishness). Here
  the subject is the relative pronoun yo (that which, nominative singular) with its
  attribute, the noun bālo (fool, nominative singular). The verb is maññati (knows,
  3rd person, singular, passive, indicative, present tense). The object is the noun
  bālyaṃ (foolishness, accusative singular). 2) paṇḍito vāpi tena so (just by that
  he is like a wise man). The subject is the personal pronoun so (he, nominative singular)
  with its attribute, the noun paṇḍito (wise man, nominative singular). The two particles,
  va (like) and api (also) form an attribute to these two words. The verb is omitted,
  implying the verb "to be". It has an attribute, the pronoun tena (by that, instrumental
  singular). In the second sentence, the subject is the personal pronoun sa (he, nominative
  singular). It has the word bālo (fool, nominative singular) as an attribute. This
  word has its own attribute, the adjective paṇḍitamānī (proud of his cleverness,
  nominative singular). The verb is vuccati (is called, 3rd person, singular, passive,
  indicative, present tense). It has the clause bālo ti ("fool", bālo: fool, nominative
  singular; ti: particle symbolizing the end of the direct speech) as an attribute.
  The conjunction ca (and) serves as a connection to the first sentence. The particle
  ve (indeed) serves mainly for metrical purposes.'
64: Two lines of this verse form two related sentences. In the first sentence, the
  subject is the noun bālo (fool, nominative singular). The verb is payirupāsati (attends
  on, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense). The object is the
  noun paṇḍitaṃ (a wise man, accusative singular). The sentence is introduced and
  connected to the second sentence by the adverb yāvajīvam (for a whole life). There
  are two particles, pi (also, even) and ce (if) which form a phrase pi ce (even if).
  The subject of the second sentence is the personal pronoun so (he, nominative singular).
  The verb is vijānāti (understands, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present
  tense). It is negated by the negative particle na (not). The object is the noun
  dhammaṃ (Dharma, accusative singular). There is a clause in this sentence, dabbī
  sūparasaṃ yathā (like a spoon the taste of the soup). The subject here is the noun
  dabbī (spoon, nominative singular) and the object the noun sūparasaṃ (the taste
  of the soup, accusative singular). The verb is omitted in the clause; the negated
  verb na vijānāti (does not know) from the main sentence is implied. The relative
  adverb yathā (just like) connects the clause to the main sentence.
65: Two lines of this verse form two related sentences. In the first sentence, the
  subject is the noun/adjective viññū (intelligent person, nominative singular). The
  verb is payirupāsati (attends on, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present
  tense). The object is the noun paṇḍitaṃ (a wise man, accusative singular). The verb
  has an attribute, the noun muhuttam (for a second, accusative singular). There are
  two particles, api (also, even) and ce (if) which form a phrase api ce (even if).
  The subject of the second sentence is omitted, implying the subject of the previous
  sentence (viññū). The verb is vijānāti (understands, 3rd person, singular, active,
  indicative, present tense). It has an attribute, the adverb khippaṃ (quickly). The
  object is the noun dhammaṃ (Dharma, accusative singular). There is a clause in this
  sentence, jivhā sūparasaṃ yathā (like a tongue the taste of the soup). The subject
  here is the noun jivhā (tongue, nominative singular) and the object the noun sūparasaṃ
  (the taste of the soup, accusative singular). The verb is omitted in the clause;
  the verb vijānāti (knows) from the main sentence is implied. The relative adverb
  yathā (just like) connects the clause to the main sentence.
66: The subject of this sentence is the noun bālā (fools, nominative plural). It has
  two attributes, the adjective dummedhā (stupid, nominative plural) and the active
  present participle karontā (doing, nominative plural). This last word has itself
  an attribute, the noun kammaṃ (deed, accusative singular) and that in turn has the
  adjective pāpakaṃ (bad, accusative singular) as an attribute. To this noun kammaṃ
  there is a dependent clause, yaṃ hoti kaṭukapphalaṃ (which has bitter fruit). Here,
  the subject is the relative pronoun yaṃ (that which, nominative singular). The object
  is the compound kaṭukapphalaṃ (having bitter fruit, nominative singular) and the
  verb is hoti (is, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense). In the
  main sentence, the verb is caranti (behave, 3rd person, plural, active, indicative,
  present tense). This verb has an attribute, the noun attanā (with oneself, instrumental
  singular). This noun has the noun amittena (with enemy, instrumental singular),
  strengthened by the particle eva (just), as an attribute.
67: This verse consists of one main sentence and two subordinate clauses. The main
  sentence is na taṃ kammaṃ kataṃ sādhu (that deed is not well done). The subject
  of this sentence is the noun kammaṃ (deed, nominative singular) with its attribute,
  the personal pronoun taṃ (that, nominative singular). The past participle kataṃ
  (done, nominative singular), which is negated by the negative particle na (not),
  serves as the verb. It has an attribute, the adverb sādhu (well). The first subordinate
  clause is yaṃ katvā anutappati (which one regrets when it is accomplished). Here,
  the subject is the relative pronoun yaṃ (that which, nominative singular). It also
  connects the clause to the main sentence. The verbal phrase katvā anutappati (having
  done - regrets) serves as the verb here. The word katvā (having done) is in the
  gerundive, the verb anutappati (regrets) is in the 3rd person, singular, passive,
  indicative, present tense. The second subordinate clause is yassa assumukho rodaṃ
  vipākaṃ paṭisevati (whose consequences one faces with a tearful face and crying).
  The subject is missing; any personal pronoun can be implied. This missing subject
  has two attributes, the adjective assumukho (with a tearful face, nominative singular)
  and the active present participle rodaṃ (crying, nominative singular). The verb
  is paṭisevati (follows, faces, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present
  tense). The object is the word vipākaṃ (consequence, accusative singular). The relative
  pronoun yassa (whose, genitive singular) points to the subject of the main sentence
  (kammaṃ) and it connects this clause to the main sentence.
68: This verse consists of one main sentence and two subordinate clauses. The main
  sentence is taṃ ca kammaṃ kataṃ sādhu (that deed is well done). The subject of this
  sentence is the noun kammaṃ (deed, nominative singular) with its attribute, the
  personal pronoun taṃ (that, nominative singular). The past participle kataṃ (done,
  nominative singular) serves as the verb. It has an attribute, the adverb sādhu (well).
  The conjunction ca (and) serves mainly metrical purposes. The first subordinate
  clause is yaṃ katvā na anutappati (which one does not regret when it is accomplished).
  Here, the subject is the relative pronoun yaṃ (that which, nominative singular).
  It also connects the clause to the main sentence. The verbal phrase katvā na anutappati
  (having done - does not regret) serves as the verb here. The word katvā (having
  done) is in the gerundive, the verb anutappati (regrets) is in the 3rd person, singular,
  passive, indicative, present tense and is negated by the negative particle na (not).
  The second subordinate clause is yassa patīto sumano vipākaṃ paṭisevati (whose consequences
  one faces delighted and happy). The subject is missing; any personal pronoun can
  be implied. This missing subject has two attributes, the adjective patīto (delighted,
  nominative singular) and the adjective sumano (happy, nominative singular). The
  verb is paṭisevati (follows, faces, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present
  tense). The object is the word vipākaṃ (consequence, accusative singular). The relative
  pronoun yassa (whose, genitive singular) points to the subject of the main sentence
  (kammaṃ) and it connects this clause to the main sentence.
69: Two lines of this verse form two syntactically separate sentences. The first line
  consists of two sentences. The first is madhuṃ va maññati bālo (the fool thinks
  it is as honey). The subject here is the noun bālo (fool, nominative singular) and
  the verb maññati (thinks, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense).
  The object is the noun madhuṃ (honey, accusative singular) with the particle va
  (as, like). The first sentence is yāva pāpaṃ na paccati (as long as the evil is
  not ripe). The subject is the noun pāpaṃ (evil, nominative singular). The verb is
  paccati (is cooked, 3rd person, singular, passive, indicative, present tense), which
  is negated by the negative prefix na (not). The relative adverb yāva (as long as)
  connects this sentence to the previous one. The second line also consists of two
  sentences. One is yadā ca paccati pāpaṃ (when the evil is ripe). The subject here
  is the noun pāpaṃ (evil, nominative singular). The verb is paccati (is cooked, 3rd
  person, singular, passive, indicative, present tense). The conjunction ca (and)
  serves mainly metrical purposes but it also fulfills the role of connecting the
  two lines together. The relative adverb yadā (when) connects this sentence to the
  following one. The second sentence is atha dukkhaṃ nigacchati (then he undergoes
  suffering). The subject is omitted, implying a personal pronoun. The verb is nigacchati
  (undergoes, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present tense). The object
  is the noun dukkhaṃ (suffering, accusative singular). The adverb atha (then) connects
  this sentence to the previous one.
70: Two lines of this verse form two separate sentences. In the first sentence, the

  The verb is omitted, implying the verb muccati from the main sentence. The particle
  va (like) connects the clause to the main sentence. In the second sentence, the
  subject is the personal pronoun taṃ (it, nominative singular; it points to the noun
  kammaṃ from the first sentence). It has an attribute, the active present participle

  icchā (desire, nominative singular) and māno (pride, nominative singular). They
  are connected by the conjunction ca (and). The verb is vaḍḍhati (grows, 3rd person,
  singular, active, indicative, present tense). The rest of this verse forms the first
  sentence. It can be further divided into the main sentence and the direct speech.

75: 'This verse consists of two syntactically separated sentences. The first line
  forms the first sentence; the second and third lines form the second sentence. The
  first sentence has two paratactic parts. The first is aññā hi lābhūpanisā (something
  else are worldly gains). The subject here is lābhūpanisā (means of gain, nominative
  singular). The verb is omitted, implying the verb "to be". This verb has an attribute,

  (leading to the Nirvana, nominative singular). The verb is again omitted; the verb
  "to be" is implied. This verb has the adjective aññā (different, nominative singular)
  for an attribute. The second sentence consists also of two main segments. The first
  is evam etaṃ abhiññāya bhikkhu buddhassa sāvako (thus a monk, the Buddha''s student,
  having fully understood this). The subject of this sentence is the noun bhikkhu
  (monk, nominative singular). It has an attribute, the noun sāvako (student, nominative
  singular). This word has its own attribute, the noun buddhassa (the Buddha''s, genitive
  singular). The verb is in the gerundive, abhiññāya (having understood). The object
  is the pronoun etaṃ (this, accusative singular) with its attribute, the adverb evam
  (thus, in such way). The second segment (sakkāraṃ nābhinandeyya vivekam anubrūhaye
  - let him not rejoice at worship, but let him devote himself to solitude) contains
  two paratactic parts: 1) sakkāraṃ nābhinandeyya (let him not rejoice at worship).
  The subject is omitted, implying the subject of the previous segment (bhikkhu).
  The verb is abhinandeyya (let him rejoice, 3rd person, singular, active, optative).
  It is negated by the negative particle na (not). The object is the noun sakkāraṃ
  (worship, accusative singular). 2) vivekam anubrūhaye (let him devote himself to
  solitude). The subject is again the noun bhikkhu from the main segment (here omitted).
  The verb is anubrūhaye (let him practice, 3rd person, singular, active, optative).
  The object is the noun vivekam (solitude, accusative singular).'
76: 'This verse consists of two sentences. The first two lines form the first one
  and the second line contains the second one. The first sentence can be subdivided
  into two sentences. 1) nidhīnaṃ va pavattāraṃ yaṃ passe vajjadassinaṃ niggayhavādiṃ
  medhāviṃ (should one see an intelligent person, who speaks rebukingly who can see
  faults as if showing treasures). The subject is omitted; any personal pronoun can
  be implied. The verb is passe (one should see, 3rd person, singular, active, optative).
  The main object is the relative pronoun yaṃ (whom, accusative singular). This object
  has three attributes: medhāviṃ (intelligent one, accusative singular), niggayhavādiṃ
  (speaking rebukingly, accusative singular) and vajjadassinaṃ (seeing faults, accusative
  singular). This last word has an attribute clause, nidhīnaṃ va pavattāraṃ (like
  showing treaures). Here the main attribute is pavattāraṃ (one who shows, accusative

  The particle va (like) connects the clause to the word vajjadassinaṃ. 2) tādisaṃ
  paṇḍitaṃ bhaje (one should associate with such a wise one). Again, the subject is
  omitted. The verb is bhaje (one should associate, 3rd person, singular, active,
  optative). The object is paṇḍitaṃ (wise one, accusative singular) with its attribute,
  the adjective tādisaṃ (such, accusative singular). In the second sentence, the subject

  singular), negated by the negative particle na (not), forms an attribute to the
  subject. The verb is hoti (is, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present
  tense). The object is the medium present participle bhajamānassa (of the one who
  associates, genitive singular) with the adjective tādisaṃ (such, accusative singular)
  as an attribute.'
77: The first line of this verse is composed of three parts. In all of them, the subject
  is omitted, because the verb form indicates the third person singular personal pronoun.
  1) ovadeyya (he should admonish, 3rd person, singular, active, optative). 2) anusāseyya
  (he should give advice, 3rd person, singular, active, optative). 3) asabbhā ca nivāraye
  (and he should restrain one from evil). Here the noun asabbhā (from evil, ablative
  singular) is the object and the conjunction ca (and) connects this sentence to the
  previous two. In the second line there are two sentences. 1) sataṃ hi so piyo hoti
  (he is indeed dear to the good ones). The subject is the pronoun so (he, nominative
  singular). The verb is hoti (is, 3rd person, singular, active, indicative, present
  tense). The object is the adjective piyo (dear, nominative singular) with its attribute,
  the active present participle sataṃ (for the good ones, genitive plural). This word
  is stressed by the particle hi (indeed). The second sentence is asataṃ hoti appiyo
  ([he] is not agreeable to the bad ones). The subject is omitted; the pronoun so
  from the previous sentence is implied. The verb is again hoti (as above). The object
  is the adjective appiyo (not agreeable, nominative singular) with its attribute,
  the active present participle asataṃ (for the bad ones, genitive plural).
78: This verse consists of four sentences. 1) na bhaje pāpake mitte (one should not
  associate with evil friends). The subject is omitted, because from the verb form
  it is clear that a third person singular pronoun is implied. The verb is bhaje (one
  should associate, 3rd person, singular, active, optative), which is negated by the
  negative particle na (not). The object is the noun mitte (friends, accusative plural)
  with its attribute, the adjective pāpake (evil, accusative plural). 2) na bhaje
  purisādhame (one should not associate with vile people). As above, the subject is
  the omitted personal pronoun for the third person singular. The verb is again bhaje
  (see above) negated by the negative particle na (not). The object is the compound
  purisādhame (vile people, accusative plural). 3) bhajetha mitte kalyāṇe (associate
  with virtuous friends). This time, the omitted subject is the second person plural
  pronoun, as implied from the verb form. The verb is bhajetha (you should associate,
  2nd person, plural, active, optative). The object is the noun mitte (friends, accusative
  plural) with its attribute, the adjective kalyāṇe (virtuous, accusative plural).
