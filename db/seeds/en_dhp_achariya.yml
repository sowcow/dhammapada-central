            :text: Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are
              all mind-wrought. If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts suffering

              faith and earnest effort. '

            :number: 10
            :text: But whoever is purged of depravity, well-established in virtues
              and filled with self-control and truthfulness, he indeed is worthy of

            :text: The evil-doer suffers here and hereafter; he suffers in both the
              worlds. The thought, "Evil have I done," torments him, and he suffers
              even more when gone to realms of woe.
          18:
            :number: 18
            :text: The doer of good delights here and hereafter; he delights in both

            :text: Little though he recites the sacred texts, but puts the Teaching
              into practice, forsaking lust, hatred, and delusion, with true wisdom
              and emancipated mind, clinging to nothing of this or any other world

            :number: 34
            :text: As a fish when pulled out of water and cast on land throbs and

            :text: Wonderful, indeed, it is to subdue the mind, so difficult to subdue,
